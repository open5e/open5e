Cover
=====

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during
combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit
from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the
opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources
of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees
aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature
that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover,
the target has three-quarters cover.

A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving
throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of
its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture,
a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or
a friend.

A target with **three-quarters cover** has a +5 bonus to AC and
Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about
three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a
portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with **total cover** can't be targeted directly by an attack or
a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in
an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely
concealed by an obstacle.
