Underwater Combat
=================

When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off
sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon
room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the
following rules apply.

When making a **melee weapon attack**, a creature that doesn't have a
swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on
the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword,
spear, or trident.

A **ranged weapon attack** automatically misses a target beyond the
weapon's normal range. Even against a target within normal range, the
attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or
a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or
dart).

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance
to fire damage.
