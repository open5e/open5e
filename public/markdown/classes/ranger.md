Class Abilities
---------------

### Favored Enemy

Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying,
tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.

Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials,
constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities,
oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two races of
humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.

You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored
enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about
them.

When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice
that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated
language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should
reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.

### Natural Explorer

You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and
are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of
favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or
swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your
favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a
skill that you're proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain
the following benefits:

-   Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
-   Your group can't become lost except by magical means.
-   Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such
    as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
-   If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal
    pace.
-   When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.
-   While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number,
    their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.

### Fighting Style

At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your
specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a
Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose
again.

#### Archery

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons,
you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability
modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Spellcasting

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical
essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See
srd:spellcasting for the general rules of spellcasting and the
srd:ranger-spells list.

#### Spell Slots

The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a
slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell srd:animal-friendship and
have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast
srd:animal-friendship using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more
ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level
for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level
in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your
magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you
cast and when making an attack roll with one.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
>
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
> modifier

### Ranger Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate, such
as the Hunter. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at
7th, 11th, and 15th level.

### Primeval Awareness

Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger
spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1
minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the
following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within
up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations,
celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature
doesn't reveal the creatures' location or number.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Land's Stride

Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs
you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants
without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they
have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are
magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created
by the srd:entangle spell.

### Hide in Plain Sight

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for
yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and
other naturally occurring materials with which to create your
camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing
yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at
least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity
(Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking
actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must
camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

### Vanish

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on
your turn. Also, you can't be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you
choose to leave a trail.

### Feral Senses

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight
creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your
inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls
against it.

You are also aware of the location of any srd:invisible creature within
30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you
aren't srd:blinded or srd:deafened.

### Foe Slayer

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once
on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack
roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your
favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the
roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

Ranger Archetypes
-----------------

A classic expression of the ranger ideal is the Hunter.

> Hunter is the only archetype that was included in the [5e
> SRD](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf). We

### Hunter

Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark
between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the
Hunter's path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats
you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and
terrifying dragons.

#### Hunter's Prey

At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

##### Colossus Slayer

Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a
creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if
it's below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only
once per turn.

##### Giant Killer

When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you
with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature
immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.

##### Horde Breaker

Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make
another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is
within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.

#### Defensive Tactics

At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

##### Escape the Horde

Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

##### Multiattack Defense

When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC
against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the
turn.

##### Steel Will

You have advantage on saving throws against being srd:frightened.

#### Multiattack

At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

##### Volley

You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of
creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon's
range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make
a separate attack roll for each target.

##### Whirlwind Attack

You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of
creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each
target.

#### Superior Hunter's Defense

At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

##### Evasion

When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon's fiery breath
or a srd:lightning-bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity
saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you
succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.

##### Stand Against the Tide

When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your
reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against
another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

##### Uncanny Dodge

When an attacker that you can see hits you with an
attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against
you.
