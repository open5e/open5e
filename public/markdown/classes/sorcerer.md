Class Abilities
---------------

### Spellcasting

An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an
indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of
magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the
srd:sorcerer-spells list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your
choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the
Sorcerer table.

#### Spell Slots

The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells,
you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *burning hands* and have a
1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *burning
hands* using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the
srd:sorcerer-spells list.

The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more
sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level
for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level
in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since
the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into
the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you cast and when
making an attack roll with one.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
> modifier
>
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
> modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer
spells.

### Sorcerous Origin

Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate
magical power, such as Draconic Bloodline.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and
again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Font of Magic

At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself.
This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to
create a variety of magical effects.

#### Sorcery Points

You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels,
as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can
never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level.
You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.

#### Flexible Casting

You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or
sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other
ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.

**Creating Spell Slots.** You can transform unexpended sorcery points
into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell
Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level.
You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a
long rest.

#### Creating Spell Slots

  ---------------------------------------
  Spell Slot    Sorcery Point Cost
  Level         
  ------------- -------------------------
  1st           2

  2nd           3

  3rd           5

  4th           6

  5th           7
  ---------------------------------------

**Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points.** As a bonus action on your
turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points
equal to the slot's level.

### Metamagic

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your
needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice.
You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it,
unless otherwise noted.

#### Careful Spell

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving
throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full
force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those
creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A
chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the
spell.

#### Distant Spell

When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can
spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.

When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery
point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

#### Empowered Spell

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to
reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum
of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different
Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

#### Extended Spell

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can
spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of
24 hours.

#### Heightened Spell

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to
resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of
the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

#### Quickened Spell

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend
2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this
casting.

#### Subtle Spell

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without
any somatic or verbal components.

#### Twinned Spell

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a
range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the
spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell
(1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one
creature at the spell's current level. For example, srd:magic-missile
and srd:scorching-ray aren't eligible, but srd:ray-of-frost is.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Sorcerous Restoration

At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish
a short rest.

Sorcerous Origins
-----------------

Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic, such
as a draconic bloodline.

> SRD](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf). We

### Draconic Bloodline

Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your
blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin
trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made
a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent.
Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are
obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a
result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.

#### Dragon Ancestor

At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage
type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

  Draconic Ancestry             Dragon Damage Type
  ----------------------------- -------------------------------
  Black                         Acid
  Blue                          Lightning
  Brass                         Fire
  Bronze                        Lightning
  Copper                        Acid
  Gold                          Fire
  Green                         Poison
  Red                           Fire
  Silver                        Cold
  White                         Cold

You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make
a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus
is doubled if it applies to the check.

#### Draconic Resilience

As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your
dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum
increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in
this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of
dragon-like scales. When you aren't wearing armor, your AC equals 13 +
your Dexterity modifier.

#### Elemental Affinity

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the
type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma
modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can
spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

#### Dragon Wings

At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings
from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You
can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until
you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

You can't manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is
made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your
wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

#### Draconic Presence

Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your
dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or
srd:frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on
this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance
of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you
were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts
its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
srd:charmed (if you chose awe) or srd:frightened (if you chose fear)
until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is
immune to your aura for 24 hours.
