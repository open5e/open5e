# Time

In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important,
the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different
time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a
dungeon environment, the adventurers' movement happens on a scale of
**minutes**. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway,
another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall,
and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything
interesting or valuable.

In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often more appropriate.
Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the heart of the forest
hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four hours' time.

For long journeys, a scale of **days** works best. Following the road
from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers spend four uneventful
days before a goblin ambush interrupts their journey.

In combat and other fast-paced situations, the game relies on
**rounds**, a 6-second span of time.
