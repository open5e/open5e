# Conditions

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can
arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or
other effect. Most conditions, such as `srd:blinded`, are impairments,
but a few, such as `srd:invisible`, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the `srd:prone`
condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration
specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each
instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's
effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is
subjected to a condition.

## Blinded

-   A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability
    check that requires sight.
-   Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's
    attack rolls have disadvantage.

## Charmed

-   A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer
    with harmful abilities or magical effects.
-   The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially
    with the creature.

## Deafened

-   A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability
    check that requires hearing.

## Exhaustion

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and
the long---term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead
to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six
levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion,
as specified in the effect's description.

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Level</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>Disadvantage on ability checks</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2</td>
<td>Speed halved</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4</td>
<td>Hit point maximum halved</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>5</td>
<td>Speed reduced to 0</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>6</td>
<td>Death</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes
exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount
specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well
as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2
exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the
effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's
exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1,
provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

## Frightened

-   A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack
    rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
-   The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

## Grappled

-   A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any
    bonus to its speed.
-   The condition ends if the grappler is `srd:incapacitated` (see the
    condition).
-   The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature
    from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a
    creature is hurled away by the `srd:thunderwave` spell.

## Incapacitated

-   An incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions.

## Invisible

-   An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic
    or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is
    heavily obscured. The creature's location can be detected by any
    noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
-   Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the
    creature's attack rolls have advantage.

## Paralyzed

-   A paralyzed creature is `srd:incapacitated` and can't move or speak.
-   The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving
    throws.

-   Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker
    is within 5 feet of the creature.

## Petrified

    object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance
    (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it
    ceases aging.

    unaware of its surroundings.
-   Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.
-   The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving
    throws.
-   The creature has resistance to all damage.
-   The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or
    disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

## Poisoned

-   A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability
    checks.

## Prone

-   A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it
    stands up and thereby ends the condition.
-   The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
-   An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is
