# Background

## Alignment

A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly
describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination
of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and
the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic,
or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible
combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical
behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary
significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly
and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

**Lawful good** (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing
as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are
lawful good.

**Neutral good** (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according
to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are
neutral good.

**Chaotic good** (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with
little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and
unicorns are chaotic good.

**Lawful neutral** (LN) individuals act in accordance with law,
tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful
neutral.

**Neutral** (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of
moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time.
Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.

**Chaotic neutral** (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their
personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some
bards, are chaotic neutral.

**Lawful evil** (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within
the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue
dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.

**Neutral evil** (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can
get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud
giants, and goblins are neutral evil.

**Chaotic evil** (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by
their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are
chaotic evil.

### Alignment in the Multiverse


For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans,
dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow
the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the
good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose
their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.

The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to
serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the
nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the
orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a
good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its
entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god's
influence.)

Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A
devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn't tend toward
lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow
ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.

Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have
alignments---they are **unaligned**. Such a creature is incapable of
making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial
nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil;
they have no alignment.

## Languages

Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default,
and your background might give you access to one or more additional
languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.

Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one
that is common in your campaign. With your GM's permission, you can
instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret
language, such as thieves' cant or the tongue of druids.

Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many
dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran,
Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental
planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can
communicate with one another.

## Inspiration

Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing
your character in a way that's true to his or her personality traits,
ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your
personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge
in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call
on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect
of a spell that has been laid on you.

### Gaining Inspiration

Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons.
Typically, GMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give
in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray
your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can
earn inspiration in the game.

You either have inspiration or you don't---you can't stockpile multiple
"inspirations" for later use.

### Using Inspiration

If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll,
saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you
advantage on that roll.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for
good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in
the game. When another player character does something that really
contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up
your inspiration to give that character inspiration.

## Backgrounds

Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where
you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the
world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled
soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue
might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a
jester.

Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your
character's identity. The most important question to ask about your
background is *what changed*? Why did you stop doing whatever your
background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money
to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy
background, why don't you have *more* money? How did you learn the
skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share
your background?

The sample background presented here provides both concrete benefits
(features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

### Proficiencies

Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described
in "Using Ability Scores").

In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or
more tools (detailed in "`srd:equipment`").

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different
sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind
(skill or tool) instead.

### Languages

Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages
beyond those given by race. See `srd:languages`."

### Equipment

Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the
optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting
equipment from your background.

### Suggested Characteristics

A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your
background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them
randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of
your own creation.

### Customizing a Background

You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it
better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a
background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any
two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages
from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package
from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment
section. (If you spend coin, you can't also take the equipment package
suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one
ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can't find a feature that matches
your desired background, work with your GM to create one.

**Looking for more Backgrounds?**

Only one background was included in the [5e
SRD](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/SRD-OGL_V5.1.pdf). We
are hoping to expand using homebrew or third-party content.

If you know of high-quality content that would be a good fit, please
[contact us](mailto:gm@5esrd.com) or [submit it on
github](https://github.com/eepMoody/open5e).

### Acolyte

You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or
pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the
holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering
sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the
divine. You are not necessarily a cleric---performing sacred rites is
not the same thing as channeling divine power.

Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from
among those listed in "Fantasy-Historical Pantheons" or those specified
by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your religious
service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from
childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high
priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different
way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any
established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a
fiendish master that you now deny.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Religion

**Languages:** Two of your choice

**Equipment:** A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the
priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense,
vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp

### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful

As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith,
and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your
adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a
temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you
must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share
your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen
deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the
temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or
a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you
can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you
ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your
temple.

### Suggested Characteristics

Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious
communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and
their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their
mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or
heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.
