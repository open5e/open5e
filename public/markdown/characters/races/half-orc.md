# Half-orc

Your half-orc character has certain traits deriving from your orc
ancestry.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your
Constitution score increases by 1.

**Age.** Half-orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching
adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live
longer than 75 years.

**Alignment.** Half-orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their orc
parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-orcs raised
among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are usually
evil.

**Size.** Half-orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans, and
they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Darkvision.** Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in
dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you
as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You
can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**Menacing.** You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.

**Relentless Endurance.** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not
killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can't use this
feature again until you finish a long rest.

**Savage Attacks.** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon
attack, you can roll one of the weapon's damage dice one additional time
and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a
harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its
own but is written in the Dwarvish script.
