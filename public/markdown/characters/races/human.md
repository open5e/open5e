# Human

It's hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character
has these traits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your ability scores each increase by 1.

**Age.** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a
century.

**Alignment.** Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best and
the worst are found among them.

**Size.** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to
well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your
size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. **Languages.** You can
speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.

Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with,
including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech
with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical
expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.
