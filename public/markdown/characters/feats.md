# Feats

A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a
character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and
abilities beyond what a class provides.

At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement
feature. Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that
feature to take a feat of your choice instead. You can take each feat
only once, unless the feat's description says otherwise.

You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that feat. If
you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you
regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to
have a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13
somehow---perhaps by a withering curse---you can't benefit from the
Grappler feat until your Strength is restored.

## Grappler

**Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher**

You've developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters
grappling. You gain the following benefits:

-   You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are
    grappling.
-   You can use your action to try to pin a creature `srd:grappled` by
    you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and
    the creature are both `srd:restrained` until the grapple ends.
