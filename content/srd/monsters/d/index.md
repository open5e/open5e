> ***Echolocation.*** The darkmantle can’t use its blindsight while
> deafened.

***False Appearance.*** While the darkmantle remains motionless, it is
indistinguishable from a cave formation such as a stalactite or
stalagmite.

> **Actions**

***Crush.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to
the target. If the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has
advantage on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target’s
head, and the target is also blinded and unable to breathe while the
darkmantle is attached in this way.

While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other
creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The
darkmantle’s speed also becomes 0, it can’t benefit from any bonus to
its speed, and it moves with the target.

A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13
Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach
itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.

***Darkness Aura (1/Day).*** A 15-­‐foot radius of magical darkness
extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around
corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains
concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell).
Darkvision can’t penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can
illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light
created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light
is dispelled.

***Death Throes.*** When the balor dies, it explodes, and each creature
within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70
(20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area
that aren’t being worn or carried, and it destroys the balor’s weapons.

***Fire Aura.*** At the start of each of the balor’s turns, each
creature within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and flammable
objects in the aura that aren’t being worn or carried ignite. A creature
that touches the balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5
feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.

***Magic Resistance.*** The balor has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

> ***Magic Weapons.*** The balor’s weapon attacks are magical.
>
> **Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The balor makes two attacks: one with its longsword
and one with its whip.

***Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 21 (3d8 + 8) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8) lightning
damage. If the balor scores a critical hit, it rolls damage dice three
times, instead of twice.

***Whip.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage, and the
target must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to
25 feet toward the balor.

***Teleport.*** The balor magically teleports, along with any equipment
it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can
see.

***Fetid Cloud (1/Day).*** A 10-­‐foot radius of disgusting green gas
extends out from the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, and its
area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind
disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must
succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the
start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take
either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can’t take
reactions.

nalfeshnee that can see the light must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving
throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends
for it, the

creature is immune to the nalfeshnee’s Horror Nimbus for the next 24

beast form that resembles a bat (speed 10 ft. fly 40 ft.), a centipede
(40 ft., climb 40 ft.), or a toad (40 ft., swim 40 ft.), or back into
its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for the

one with its glaive.

***Beard.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC
12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned

itself on a success.

***Glaive.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other
than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw or lose 5 (1d10) hit points at the start of each of its
turns due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded
target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 5
(1d10). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a

successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the
target receives magical healing.

***Chain.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC
14) if the devil isn’t already grappling a creature. Until this grapple
ends, the target is restrained and takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at the
start of each of its turns.

> four chains the devil can see within 60 feet of it magically sprout

Each animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance
to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When the
devil uses Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain to
make one additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one
creature of its own but can’t make attacks while grappling. An animated
chain reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points or if
the devil is incapacitated or dies.

##### Reactions

***Unnerving Mask.*** When a creature the devil can see starts its turn
within 30 feet of the devil, the devil can create the illusion that it
looks like one of the creature’s departed loved ones or bitter enemies.
If the creature can see the devil, it must succeed on a DC 14

The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies.
The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-­‐foot section has AC 5,
30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold,
necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it
leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.
Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn,
willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest
of the wall vanishes.

throw, unless the pit fiend is incapacitated. On a failed save, the
creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. If a creature’s

Fear Aura for the next 24 hours.

***Magic Resistance.*** The pit fiend has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate
barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of
metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range,
the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the
doppelganger’s concentration isn’t broken (as if concentrating on a
spell). While reading the target’s mind, the doppelganger has advantage
on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and
Persuasion) checks against the target.

beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into
its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it
is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the
dragon’s choice).

In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice,
ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its
statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new
form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.

dragon’s choice).

In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice,
ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its
statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new
form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.
