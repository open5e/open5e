(the deva’s choice).

In a new form, the deva retains its game statistics and ability to
speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special
senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any
statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions,
and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

solar is considered to be holding it. The hovering sword falls if the

###### Languages —

> **Challenge** 3 (700 XP)

**Petrifying Gaze.** If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the
basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force
the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk
isn’t incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to
turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the
end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the
creature is petrified until freed by the *greater restoration* spell or
other magic.

A creature that isn’t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving
throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see the basilisk
until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If
it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the
save.

If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright
light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.

behir isn’t already constricting a creature, and the target is
restrained until this grapple ends.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The behir exhales a line of
lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that
line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10)
lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

***Swallow.*** The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or
smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also
swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded
and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects
outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of
each of the behir’s turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed
at a time.

> If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn

from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the
creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If
the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and
can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

***Sense Magic.*** The chuul senses magic within 120 feet of it at will.
This trait otherwise works like the *detect magic* spell but isn’t
itself magical.

> **Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The chuul makes two pincer attacks. If the chuul is
grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its tentacles once.

***Pincer.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape
DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul doesn’t have
two other creatures grappled.

***Tentacles.*** One creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on a DC
13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this
poison ends, the target is paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success.

***Damage Transfer.*** While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes
only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes
the other half.

***False Appearance.*** While the cloaker remains motionless without its
underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.

***Light Sensitivity.*** While in bright light, the cloaker has
disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
sight.

> **Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and
one with its tail.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or
smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage
against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target’s head, and the
target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached.
While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target
and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by
spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can
take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength
check.

> ***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
> creature. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

***Moan.*** Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear
its moan and that isn’t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom
saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker’s next
turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune
to the cloaker’s moan for the next 24 hours

***Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The cloaker
magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn’t in
bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions,
shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is
the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the
duplicates disappear.

Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful
spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to
determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A
creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can’t see or if it
relies on senses other than sight.

A duplicate has the cloaker’s AC and uses its saving throws. If an
attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against
an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

(spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring
only verbal components:

> At will: *detect evil and good*, *detect magic*, *detect thoughts*

***Shielded Mind.*** The couatl is immune to scrying and to any effect
that would sense its emotions, read its thoughts, or detect its
location.

> **Actions**

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC
13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 24 hours. Until this
poison ends, the target is unconscious. Another creature can use an
action to shake the target awake.

***Constrict.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
Medium or smaller creature. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and
the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the
target is restrained, and the couatl can’t constrict another target.

***Change Shape.*** The couatl magically polymorphs into a humanoid or
beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back
into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any
equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form
(the couatl’s choice).

> In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics

and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity,
and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains
any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary
actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If
the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its bite in that
form.

stalagmite.

> **Actions**

***Crush.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to
the target. If the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has
advantage on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target’s
head, and the target is also blinded and unable to breathe while the
darkmantle is attached in this way.

While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other
creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The
darkmantle’s speed also becomes 0, it can’t benefit from any bonus to
its speed, and it moves with the target.

A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13
Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach
itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.

***Darkness Aura (1/Day).*** A 15-­‐foot radius of magical darkness
extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around
corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains
concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell).
Darkvision can’t penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can
illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light
created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light
is dispelled.

***Death Throes.*** When the balor dies, it explodes, and each creature
within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70
(20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area
that aren’t being worn or carried, and it destroys the balor’s weapons.

***Fire Aura.*** At the start of each of the balor’s turns, each
creature within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and flammable
objects in the aura that aren’t being worn or carried ignite. A creature
that touches the balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5
feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.

***Magic Resistance.*** The balor has advantage on saving throws against

damage. If the balor scores a critical hit, it rolls damage dice three
times, instead of twice.

***Whip.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage, and the
target must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to

area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind
disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must
succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the

***Multiattack.*** The devil makes two attacks: one with its beard and
one with its glaive.

***Beard.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC
12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned
in this way, the target can’t regain hit points. The target can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.

***Glaive.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other
than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw or lose 5 (1d10) hit points at the start of each of its
turns due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded
target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 5
(1d10). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a

successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the
target receives magical healing.

***Chain.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC
14) if the devil isn’t already grappling a creature. Until this grapple
ends, the target is restrained and takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at the
start of each of its turns.

> four chains the devil can see within 60 feet of it magically sprout

> that the chains aren’t being worn or carried.

Each animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance
to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When the
devil uses Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain to
make one additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one
creature of its own but can’t make attacks while grappling. An animated
chain reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points or if
the devil is incapacitated or dies.

##### Reactions

***Unnerving Mask.*** When a creature the devil can see starts its turn
within 30 feet of the devil, the devil can create the illusion that it
looks like one of the creature’s departed loved ones or bitter enemies.
If the creature can see the devil, it must succeed on a DC 14

The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies.
The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-­‐foot section has AC 5,
30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold,
necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it
leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.
Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn,
willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest
of the wall vanishes.

foot thick and up to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it’s a
hemispherical dome up to 20 feet in diameter.

When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of it by
the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the wall to end

barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of
metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range,
the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the

***Create Whirlwind.*** A 5-­‐foot-­‐radius, 30-­‐foot-­‐tall cylinder
of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120
feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains
concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the
djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving
throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60
feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with
it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the
whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If
the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to
the nearest space outside the whirlwind.

***Aberrant Ground.*** The ground in a 10-­‐foot radius around the
mouther is doughlike difficult terrain. Each creature that starts its
turn in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or have
its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.

***Gibbering.*** The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any
creature and isn’t incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn
within 20 feet of the mouther and can hear the gibbering must succeed on
a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can’t take
reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine
what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On
a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its
movement to move in a randomly determined

direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a
randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it
can’t make such an attack.

> **Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The gibbering mouther makes one bite attack and, if
it can, uses its Blinding Spittle.

***Bites.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 17 (5d6) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it
must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If

***Blinding Spittle (Recharge 5–6).*** The mouther spits a chemical glob
at a point it can see within 15 feet of it. The glob explodes in a
blinding flash of light on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the
flash must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until
the end of the mouther’s next turn.

***Acid Absorption***. Whenever the golem is subjected to acid damage,
it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to
the acid damage dealt.

***Berserk.*** Whenever the golem starts its turn with 60 hit points or
fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns
while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no
creature is

near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with
preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes
berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its
hit points.

***Immutable Form.*** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that
would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The golem has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

> ***Magic Weapons.*** The golem’s weapon attacks are magical.

##### Actions

> ***Multiattack.*** The golem makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point
maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies
if this attack reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts
until removed by the *greater restoration* spell or other magic.

***Haste (Recharge 5–6).*** Until the end of its next turn, the golem
magically gains a +2 bonus to its AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving
throws, and can use its slam attack as a bonus action.

> ***Change Shape.*** The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or
> Medium female humanoid, or back into her

true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she
is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. She reverts to her true form
if she dies.

***Etherealness.*** The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the
Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a
*heartstone* in her possession.

***Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).*** While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag
magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A
*protection from evil and good* spell cast on the target prevents this
contact, as does a *magic circle*. As long as the contact persists, the
target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour,
the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is
reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target’s hit point
maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is
trapped in the hag’s *soul bag*. The reduction to the target’s hit point
maximum lasts until removed by the *greater restoration* spell or
similar magic.

> ***Amphibious.*** The hag can breathe air and water.

***Horrific Appearance.*** Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30
feet of the hag and can see the hag’s true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute.
A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect
on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or
the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag’s Horrific
Appearance for the next 24 hours.

Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag’s true form
is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial
saving throw. Until the

start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage
on attack rolls against the hag.

> **Actions**
>
> ***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
> *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

***Death Glare.*** The hag targets one frightened creature she can see
within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on
a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.

***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is
wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an
ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if
the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical
inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but
someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature
must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC
16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is
disguised.

### Half-Dragon Template

A beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can become a half-­‐‑dragon. It
keeps its statistics, except as follows. ***Challenge.*** To avoid

>
> ***Club.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
> *Hit:* 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.

***Luring Song.*** The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and
giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed
on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The
harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue
singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is
incapacitated.

While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the
songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away
from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the
most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid
opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as
lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the
harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving
throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy’s song for the
next 24 hours.

***Freedom of Movement.*** The kraken ignores difficult terrain, and
magical effects can’t reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It
can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or
being grappled.

> ***Siege Monster.*** The kraken deals double damage to objects and
> structures.
>
> **Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The kraken makes three tentacle attacks, each of
which it can replace with one use of Fling.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 23 (3d8 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or
smaller creature grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and
the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and
restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside
the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of
the kraken’s turns.

If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature
inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw
at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which
fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies,
a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from
the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

***Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 30 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is
grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is
restrained. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one
target.

***Fling.*** One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by
the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked
prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3
(1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target
is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18
Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

***Lightning Storm.*** The kraken magically creates three bolts of
lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within
120 feet of it. A target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

##### Legendary Actions

The kraken can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. The kraken regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

> **Tentacle Attack or Fling.** The kraken makes one tentacle attack or
> uses its Fling.
>
> **Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions).** The kraken uses Lightning
> Storm.
>
> **Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions).** While underwater, the kraken expels
> an ink cloud in a 60-­‐foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners,
> and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken.
> Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must
> succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison
> damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A
> strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the
> end of the kraken’s next turn.

***Petrifying Gaze.*** When a creature that can see the medusa’s eyes
starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to
make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn’t incapacitated
and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the
creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the
save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature
must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming
petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The
petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the *greater
restoration* spell or other magic.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving
throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see
the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes
again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must
immediately make the save.

> If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished

surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa
is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.

***Limited Telepathy.*** The otyugh can magically transmit simple
messages and images to any creature within 120 feet of it that can
understand a language. This form of telepathy doesn’t allow the
receiving creature to telepathically respond.

##### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The otyugh makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its tentacles.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or
become poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse,
the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum
by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target
dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction
to the target’s hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

***Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) piercing
damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC
13) and restrained until the grapple ends. The otyugh has two tentacles,
each of which can grapple one target.

***Tentacle Slam.*** The otyugh slams creatures grappled by it into each
other or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw or take 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and be
stunned until the end of the otyugh’s next turn. On a successful save,
the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn’t stunned.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 22 (3d8 + 9) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller
creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be
swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained,
it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm,
and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the worm’s
turns.

If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature
inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at
the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall
prone in a space within 10 feet of the worm. If the worm dies, a
swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the
corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.

***Tail Stinger.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
creature. *Hit:* 19 (3d6 + 9) piercing damage, and the target must make

ends, the target is restrained, and the remorhaz can’t bite another
target.

***Swallow.*** The remorhaz makes one bite attack against a Medium or
smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature

***Grasping Tendrils.*** The roper can have up to six tendrils at a
time. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to
poison and psychic damage). Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the
roper, which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn. A
tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on
a DC 15 Strength check against it.

***Spider Climb.*** The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including

***Iron Scent.*** The rust monster can pinpoint, by scent, the location
of ferrous metal within 30 feet of it.

***Rust Metal.*** Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the rust
monster corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and

rust monster is destroyed after dealing damage.

> **Actions**

being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a DC 11
Dexterity saving throw to avoid the rust monster’s touch.

If the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being worn
or carried, its takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it
offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0
bonus is destroyed. If the object touched is a held metal weapon, it
rusts as described in the Rust Metal trait.

different, as detailed below. Each creature within 500 feet of the
sphinx and able to hear the roar must make a saving throw.

dies.

While in mist form, the vampire can’t take any actions, speak, or
manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can
hover, and can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. In
addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without
squeezing, and it can’t pass through water. It has advantage on
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution

saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the
damage it takes from sunlight.

> ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the vampire fails a saving
> throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Misty Escape.*** When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting
place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the
Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it
isn’t in sunlight or running water. If it can’t transform, it is
destroyed.

While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can’t revert to its vampire
form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be
destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It
is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending
1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.

***Regeneration.*** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of
its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running
water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water,
this trait doesn’t function at the start of the vampire’s next turn.

***Spider Climb.*** The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

> ***Vampire Weaknesses.*** The vampire has the following flaws:

*Forbiddance.* The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation
from one of the occupants.

> *Harmed by Running Water.* The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends
> its turn in running water.
>
> *Stake to the Heart.* If a piercing weapon made of

wood is driven into the vampire’s heart while the vampire is
incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the
stake is removed.

*Sunlight Hypersensitivity.* The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it
starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on
attack rolls and ability checks.

> **Actions**
>
> ***Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).*** The vampire makes two attacks,
> only one of which can be a bite attack.
>
> ***Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to
> hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 +

4\) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can
grapple the target (escape DC 18).

> ***Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit,
> reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by
> the vampire, incapacitated,

or restrained. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic
damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to
the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to
that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.
The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A
humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the
following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire’s control.

***Charm.*** The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet
of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a
DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the
vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to
be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the vampire’s
control, it takes the vampire’s requests or actions in the most
favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire’s bite
attack.

Each time the vampire or the vampire’s companions do anything harmful to
the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself
on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire
is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or
takes a bonus action to end the effect.

***Children of the Night (1/Day).*** The vampire magically calls 2d4
swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn’t up. While outdoors,
the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in
1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken
commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until
the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.

##### Legendary Actions

The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. The vampire regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

> **Move.** The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking

> **Bite (Costs 2 Actions).** The vampire makes one bite attack.

Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) cold damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.

The arctic-­‐‑dwelling **winter wolf** is as large as a dire wolf but
has snow-­‐‑white fur and pale blue eyes. Frost giants use these evil
creatures as guards and hunting companions, putting the wolves’ deadly
breath weapon to use against their foes. Winter wolves communicate with
one another using growls and barks, but they speak Common and Giant well
enough to follow simple conversations.

Nonplayer Characters
====================

This appendix contains statistics for various humanoid nonplayer
characters (NPCs) that adventurers might encounter during a campaign,
including lowly commoners and mighty archmages. These stat blocks can be
used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.

### Customizing NPCs

There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your
home campaign.

***Racial Traits.*** You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a
halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding
racial traits to an NPC doesn’t alter its challenge rating. For more on
racial traits, see the *Player’s Handbook*.

***Spell Swaps.*** One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace
one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC’s
spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell

***Spellcasting.*** The acolyte is a 1st-­‐level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell
attacks). The acolyte has following cleric spells prepared:

> Cantrips (at will): *light*, *sacred flame*, *thaumaturgy*
>
> 1st level (3 slots): *bless*, *cure wounds*, *sanctuary*

##### Actions

> ***Club.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
> *Hit:* 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage.

**Acolytes** are junior members of a clergy, usually answerable to a
priest. They perform a variety of functions in a temple and are granted
minor spellcasting power by their deities.

> **Archmage**
>
> *Medium humanoid (any race), any alignment*
>
> **Armor Class** 12 (15 with *mage armor*)
>
> **Hit Points** 99 (18d8 + 18)
>
> **Speed** 30 ft.

list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t alter an

NPC’s challenge rating.

***Armor and Weapon Swaps.*** You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s
armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage
can change an NPC’s challenge rating.

***Magic Items.*** The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one
or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might
have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls.
Giving an NPC a potent damage-­‐‑dealing magic item could alter its
challenge rating.

***Magic Resistance.*** The archmage has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** The archmage is an 18th-­‐level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17,

+9 to hit with spell attacks). The archmage can cast

**Archmages** are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters
dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings
and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those
who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to
practice their magic without interruption.

An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an
archmage’s abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage
interlopers.

#### Assassin

> *Medium humanoid (any race), any non-­‐good alignment*
>
> **Armor Class** 15 (studded leather)
>
> **Hit Points** 78 (12d8 + 24)
>
> **Speed** 30 ft.

###### STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA

> 11 (+0) 16 (+3) 14 (+2) 13 (+1) 11 (+0) 10 (+0)

>
> **Damage Resistances** poison
>
> **Senses** passive Perception 13
>
> **Languages** Thieves’ cant plus any two languages
>
> **Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP)

***Assassinate.*** During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on
attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn. Any hit the
assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

***Evasion.*** If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it
to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin
instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only
half damage if it fails.

***Sneak Attack.*** Once per turn, the assassin deals an extra 14 (4d6)
damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on
the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the
assassin that isn’t incapacitated and the assassin doesn’t have
disadvantage on the attack roll.

> **Actions**
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The assassin makes two shortsword attacks.

***Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a
DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Light Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 80/320 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Trained in the use of poison, **assassins** are remorseless killers who
work for nobles, guildmasters, sovereigns, and anyone else who can
afford them.

#### Bandit

> *Medium humanoid (any race), any non-­‐lawful alignment*
>
> **Armor Class** 12 (leather armor)
>
> **Hit Points** 11 (2d8 + 2)
>
> **Speed** 30 ft.

>
> ***Light Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, range 80
> ft./320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

**Bandits** rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or
spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or
famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.

> **Pirates** are bandits of the high seas. They might be

freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be
privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy
nation’s vessels.

#### Bandit Captain

> *Medium humanoid (any race), any non-­‐lawful alignment*
>
> **Armor Class** 15 (studded leather)
>
> **Hit Points** 65 (10d8 + 20)
>

>
> **Skills** Athletics +4, Deception +4 **Senses** passive Perception 10
> **Languages** any two languages **Challenge** 2 (450 XP)
>
> **Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The captain makes three melee attacks: two with its
scimitar and one with its dagger. Or the captain makes two ranged
attacks with its daggers.

> ***Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
> target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.
>
> ***Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or
> range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 +

2)  piercing damage.

##### \
Reactions

***Parry.*** The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that
would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be
wielding a melee weapon.

It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to
keep a gang of bandits in line. The **bandit captain** has these
qualities in spades.

In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the **pirate
captain** is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect
and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards
and punishment on a regular basis.

> More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate

captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain’s vanity or
ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or
claims not to know anything of the captain’s colorful reputation.

#### Berserker

> *Medium humanoid (any race), any chaotic alignment*

***Reckless.*** At the start of its turn, the berserker can gain
advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack
rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

> **Actions**
>
> ***Greataxe.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one

Hailing from uncivilized lands, unpredictable **berserkers** come
together in war parties and seek conflict wherever they can find it.

**Druids** dwell in forests and other secluded wilderness locations,
where they protect the natural world from monsters and the encroachment
of civilization. Some are **tribal shamans** who heal the sick, pray to
animal spirits, and provide spiritual guidance.
