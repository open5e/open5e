Monsters (B)

### Basilisk

Medium monstrosity, unaligned

**Armor Class** 15 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 52 (8d8 + 16)

**Speed** 20 ft.

  STR       DEX      CON       INT      WIS      CHA
  --------- -------- --------- -------- -------- --------
  | 16 (+3)   | 8 (-1)   | 15 (+2)   | 2 (-4)   | 8 (-1)   | 7 (-2)

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 9

**Languages** —

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)


**Petrifying Gaze**: If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of
    the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk
    can force the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if
    the basilisk isn’t incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature
    magically begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat
    the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the
    effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by
    the *greater restoration* spell or other magic. A creature that
    isn’t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the
    start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see the basilisk until
    the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it
    looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make
    the save. If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it
    in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself
    with its gaze.


Actions

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
    *Hit*: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

### Behir

Huge monstrosity, neutral evil

**Armor Class** 17 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 168 (16d12 + 64)

**Speed** 50 ft., climb 40 ft.

  STR       DEX       CON       INT      WIS       CHA
  --------- --------- --------- -------- --------- ---------
  | 23 (+6)   | 16 (+3)   | 18 (+4)   | 7 (-2)   | 14 (+2)   | 12 (+1)

**Skills** Perception +6, Stealth +7

**Damage Immunities** lightning

**Senses** darkvision 90 ft., passive Perception 16

**Languages** Draconic

**Challenge** 11 (7,200 XP)


Actions

**Multiattack**: The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and
    one to constrict.
**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
    one target. *Hit*: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage.
**Constrict**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
    Large or smaller creature. *Hit*: 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage
    plus 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape
    DC 16) if the behir isn’t already constricting a creature, and the
    target is restrained until this grapple ends.
**Lightning Breath (Recharge 5–6)**: The behir exhales a line of
    lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in
    that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking
    66 (12d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
    on a successful one.
**Swallow**: The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or
    smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is
    also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is
    blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other
    effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the
    start of each of the behir’s turns. A behir can have only one
    creature swallowed at a time. If the behir takes 30 damage or more
    on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed
    on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or
    regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10
    feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no
    longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15
    feet of movement, exiting prone.

### Bugbear

Medium humanoid (goblinoid), chaotic evil

**Armor Class** 16 (hide armor, shield)

**Hit Points** 27 (5d8 + 5)

**Speed** 30 ft.

  STR       DEX       CON       INT      WIS       CHA
  --------- --------- --------- -------- --------- --------
  | 15 (+2)   | 14 (+2)   | 13 (+1)   | 8 (-1)   | 11 (+0)   | 9 (-1)

**Skills** Stealth +6, Survival +2

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10

**Languages** Common, Goblin

**Challenge** 1 (200 XP)


**Brute**: A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the
    bugbear hits with it (included in the attack).
**Surprise Attack**: If the bugbear surprises a creature and hits it
    with an attack during the first round of combat, the target takes an
    extra 7 (2d6) damage from the attack.


Actions

**Morningstar**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
    one target. *Hit*: 11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage.
**Javelin**: *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft.
    or range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit*: 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage
    in melee or 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage at range.

### Bulette

Large monstrosity, unaligned

**Armor Class** 17 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 94 (9d10 + 45)

**Speed** 40 ft., burrow 40 ft.

  STR       DEX       CON       INT      WIS       CHA
  --------- --------- --------- -------- --------- --------
  | 19 (+4)   | 11 (+0)   | 21 (+5)   | 2 (-4)   | 10 (+0)   | 5 (-3)

**Skills** Perception +6

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., tremorsense 60 ft., passive Perception 16

**Languages** —

**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP)


**Standing Leap**: The bulette’s long jump is up to 30 feet and its
    high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.


Actions

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
    *Hit*: 30 (4d12 + 4) piercing damage.
**Deadly Leap**: If the bulette jumps at least 15 feet as part of
    its movement, it can then use this action to land on its feet in a
    space that contains one or more other creatures. Each of those
    creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength or Dexterity saving throw
    (target’s choice) or be knocked prone and take 14 (3d6 + 4)
    bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. On a
    successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn’t
    knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet out of the bulette’s space into
    an unoccupied space of the creature’s choice. If no unoccupied space
    is within range, the creature instead falls prone in the
    bulette’s space.
