> ***Amphibious.*** The chuul can breathe air and water.

***Sense Magic.*** The chuul senses magic within 120 feet of it at will.
This trait otherwise works like the *detect magic* spell but isn’t
itself magical.

> **Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The chuul makes two pincer attacks. If the chuul is
grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its tentacles once.

***Pincer.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape
DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul doesn’t have
two other creatures grappled.

***Tentacles.*** One creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on a DC
13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this
poison ends, the target is paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success.

#### Cloaker

> *Large aberration, chaotic neutral*
>
> **Armor Class** 14 (natural armor)
>
> **Hit Points** 78 (12d10 + 12)
>
> **Speed** 10 ft., fly 40 ft.

###### STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA

> 17 (+3) 15 (+2) 12 (+1) 13 (+1) 12 (+1) 14 (+2)
>
> **Skills** Stealth +5
>
> **Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11 **Languages** Deep
> Speech, Undercommon **Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP)

***Damage Transfer.*** While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes
only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes
the other half.

***False Appearance.*** While the cloaker remains motionless without its
underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.

***Light Sensitivity.*** While in bright light, the cloaker has
disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
sight.

> **Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and
one with its tail.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or
smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage
against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target’s head, and the
target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached.
While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target
and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by
spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can
take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength
check.

> ***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
> creature. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

***Moan.*** Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear
its moan and that isn’t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom
saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker’s next
turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune
to the cloaker’s moan for the next 24 hours

***Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The cloaker
magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn’t in
bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions,
shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is
the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the
duplicates disappear.

Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful
spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to
determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A
creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can’t see or if it
relies on senses other than sight.

A duplicate has the cloaker’s AC and uses its saving throws. If an
attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against
an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC
11 Constitution saving throw against being magically petrified. On a
failed save, the creature begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It
must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success,
the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified for 24 hours.

#### Couatl

> **Damage Resistances** radiant

**Senses** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 15

> **Languages** all, telepathy 120 ft.
>
> **Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP)

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The couatl’s spellcasting ability is Charisma
(spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring
only verbal components:

> At will: *detect evil and good*, *detect magic*, *detect thoughts*

***Shielded Mind.*** The couatl is immune to scrying and to any effect
that would sense its emotions, read its thoughts, or detect its
location.

> **Actions**

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC
13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 24 hours. Until this
poison ends, the target is unconscious. Another creature can use an
action to shake the target awake.

***Constrict.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
Medium or smaller creature. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and
the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the
target is restrained, and the couatl can’t constrict another target.

***Change Shape.*** The couatl magically polymorphs into a humanoid or
beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back
into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any
equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form
(the couatl’s choice).

> In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics

and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity,
and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains
any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary
actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If
the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its bite in that
form.
