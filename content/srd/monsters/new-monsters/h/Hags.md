Title: Hags
-------------------------


#### Green Hag

Medium fey, neutral evil

**Armor Class** 17 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 82 (11d8 + 33)

**Speed** 30 ft.


  STR|         DEX|         CON|         INT|         WIS|         CHA
  -----------| -----------| -----------| -----------| -----------| ------------|
   1 (+4)   | 12 (+1)   | 16 (+3)   | 13 (+1)   | 14 (+2)   | 14 (+2)\



**Skills** Arcana +3, Deception +4, Perception +4, Stealth +3

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 14;

**Languages** Common, Draconic, Sylvan;

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)


**Amphibious**: The hag can breathe air and water.
**Innate Spellcasting**: The hag’s innate spellcasting ability is
    Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following
    spells, requiring no material components:
**At will**: *dancing lights*, *minor illusion*, *vicious mockery*
**Mimicry**: The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A
    creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a
    successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.


Actions

**Claws**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
    one target. *Hit*: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
**Illusory Appearance**: The hag covers herself and anything she is
    wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like
    another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The
    illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she
    dies.\
    \
    The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to
    physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have
    smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh.
    Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the
    illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check
    to discern that the hag is disguised.
**Invisible Passage**: The hag magically turns invisible until she
    attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if
    concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical
    evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any
    equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

#### Night Hag

   1 (+4)   | 15 (+2)   | 16 (+3)   | 16 (+3)   | 14 (+2)   | 16 (+3)

\
**Skills** Deception +7, Insight +6, Perception +6, Stealth +6

**Damage Resistances** cold, fire; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
from nonmagical attacks not made with silvered weapons

**Condition Immunities** charmed

**Senses** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 16;

**Languages** Abyssal, Common, Infernal, Primordial;

**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP)


**Innate Spellcasting**: The hag’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can
innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
**At will**: *detect magic*, *magic missile*
**2/day each**: *plane shift* (self only), *ray of enfeeblement*,
    *sleep*

**Magic Resistance**: The hag has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.


Actions

**Claws (Hag Form Only)**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5
    ft., one target. *Hit*: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
**Change Shape**: The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or
    Medium female humanoid, or back into her true form. Her statistics
    are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying
    isn’t transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.
**Etherealness**: The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from
    the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a
    *heartstone* in her possession.
**Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)**: While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag
    magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A
    *protection from evil and good* spell cast on the target prevents
    this contact, as does a *magic circle*. As long as the contact
    persists, the target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for
    at least 1 hour, the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its
    hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the
    target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target
    was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag’s *soul bag*. The reduction
    to the target’s hit point maximum lasts until removed by the
    *greater restoration* spell or similar magic.

#### Sea Hag

Medium fey, chaotic evil

**Armor Class** 14 (natural armor)

**Hit Points** 52 (7d8 + 21)

**Speed** 30 ft., swim 40 ft.

  STR|         DEX|         CON|         INT|         WIS|         CHA
  -----------| -----------| -----------| -----------| -----------| -----------|
   1 (+3)   | 13 (+1)   | 16 (+3)   | 12 (+1)   | 12 (+1)   | 13 (+1)

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11

**Languages** Aquan, Common, Giant

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)


**Amphibious**: The hag can breathe air and water.
**Horrific Appearance**: Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30
    feet of the hag and can see the hag’s true form must make a DC 11
    Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened
    for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
    each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of
    sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s
    saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature
    is immune to the hag’s Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.\
    \
    Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag’s true
    form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the
    initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature
    that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against
    the hag.


Actions

**Claws**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
    one target. *Hit*: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
**Death Glare**: The hag targets one frightened creature she can see
    within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must
    succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to
    0 hit points.
**Illusory Appearance**: The hag covers herself and anything she is
    wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like
    an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect
    ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\
    \
    The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to
    physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no
    claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws.
    Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the
    illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check
    to discern that the hag is disguised.
