**Amorphous**: The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1
    inch wide without squeezing.
**Corrosive Form**: A creature that touches the pudding or hits it
    with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4 (1d8)
    acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits
    the pudding corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a
    permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty
    drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of
    metal or wood that hits the pudding is destroyed after dealing
    damage.\
    \
    The pudding can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal
    in 1 round.
**Spider Climb**: The pudding can climb difficult surfaces,
    including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an
    ability check.


Actions

**Pseudopod**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
    one target. *Hit*: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8)
    acid damage. In addition, nonmagical armor worn by the target is
    partly dissolved and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to
    the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its
    AC to 10.


Reactions

**Split**: When a pudding that is Medium or larger is subjected to
    lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two new puddings if it
    has at least 10 hit points. Each new pudding has hit points equal to
    half the original pudding’s, rounded down. New puddings are one size
    smaller than the original pudding.

#### Gelatinous Cube\

Large ooze, unaligned

**Armor Class** 6

**Hit Points** 84 (8d10 + 40)

**Speed** 15 ft.

  STR|       DEX|      CON|       INT|      WIS|      CHA
  ---------| --------| ---------| --------| -------- --------|
   14 (+2)   | 3 (-4)   | 20 (+5)   | 1 (-5)   | 6 (-2)   | 1 (-5)

**Condition Immunities** blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion,
frightened, prone

**Senses** blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive
Perception 8

**Languages** —

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)


**Ooze Cube**: The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures
    can enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the
    cube's Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw.\
    \
    Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover.\
    \
    A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a
    creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful
    DC 12 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes
    10 (3d6) acid damage.\
    \
    The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or
    smaller creatures inside it at a time.
**Transparent**: Even when the cube is in plain sight, it takes a
    successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a cube that has
    neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the
    cube's space while unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube.


Actions

**Pseudopod**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
    one creature. *Hit*: 10 (3d6) acid damage.
**Engulf**: The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can
    enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a
    creature's space, the creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving
    throw.\
    \
    On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet
    back or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be
    pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.\
    \
    On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the
    creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed
    creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid
    damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube
    moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.\
    \
    An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a
    DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters
    a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.

**Corrode Metal**: Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the
    ooze corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent
    and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to
    -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal
    that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage.\
