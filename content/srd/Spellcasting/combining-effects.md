### Combining Magical Effects

The effects of different spells add together while the durations of
those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times
don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the
highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.

> For example, if two clerics cast *bless* on the same

target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she
doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.
