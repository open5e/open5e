Title: Flaming Sphere
-------------------------

## Flaming Sphere

#### 2nd-level conjuration


**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of
brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute


A 5 foot diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of
your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that
ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving
throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the
sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against
the sphere’s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet
tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites
flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light
in a 20 foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell
slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot
level above 2nd.
