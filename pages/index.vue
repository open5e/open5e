    <h2>The API</h2>
    <div class="side-note">
      <h3>Hey! Stuff is missing!</h3>
      <p>
        Some content you may be expecting was not released as part of the 5e
        SRD, so we arenâ€™t allowed to include it in this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are hoping to fill in the gaps using quality homebrew and 3rd party
        OGL content. Contact us or make a pull request if you know something we
        should add!
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://api.open5e.com">Open5e API</a> includes all monsters
      and spells from the SRD and other OGL sources as well as a search API, so
      you can easily access any part of the SRD from your app or website.
    </p>

    <h2>Bugs &amp; Issues</h2>
    <p>
      If you notice a bug or want to make a suggestion, join us on

      discord is a place to talk about the redesign as well as rules, tools,
      art, gaming in general, or anything else on your mind!
