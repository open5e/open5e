.. _srd:conditions:

Conditions
======================

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can
arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as
:ref:`srd:blinded`, are impairments, but a few, such as :ref:`srd:invisible`, can be
advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the :ref:`srd:prone` condition is
countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by
the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each
instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's
effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is
subjected to a condition.

.. _srd:blinded:

Blinded
-------

-  A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability
   check that requires sight.

-  Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's
   attack rolls have disadvantage.

.. _srd:charmed:

Charmed
-------

-  A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer
   with harmful abilities or magical effects.

-  The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially
   with the creature.

.. _srd:deafened:

Deafened
--------

-  A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability
   check that requires hearing.

.. _srd:exhaustion:

Exhaustion
----------

Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and
the long---term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead
to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six
levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion,
as specified in the effect's description.

===== ======
Level Effect
===== ======
1     Disadvantage on ability checks
2     Speed halved
3     Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4     Hit point maximum halved
5     Speed reduced to 0
6     Death
===== ======

If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes
exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount
specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well
as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2
exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the
effect's description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature's
exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

Finishing a long rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1,
provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.
