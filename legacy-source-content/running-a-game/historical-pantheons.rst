Fantasy-Historical Pantheons
----------------------------

The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy
interpretations of historical religions from our world's ancient times.
They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game,
divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into
pantheons that serve the needs of the game.

The Celtic Pantheon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space
that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering
wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak---and
it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the
brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and
the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared
put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling
in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.

The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they
are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.

The Greek Pantheon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves
against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the
cloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods and the sere,
olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every aspect of
nature echoes with their presence, and they've made a place for
themselves inside the human heart, too.

The Egyptian Pantheon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the
rulership of the cosmos and the

maintenance of the divine principle of Ma'at---the fundamental order of
truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and
ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the
universe.

The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for
death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god
of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic
evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris.
And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.

The Norse Pantheon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below,
where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow
forward and retreat with every fall and spring---this is the land of the
Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It's a brutal clime, and one
that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt
to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven't been too
twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of
raiding for food and wealth, it's surprising the mortals turned out as
well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for
strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in
every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the
booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning
longhouse.

The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war
and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once
enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common
enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).
