Casting a Spell
---------------

When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed,
regardless of the character's class or the spell's effects.

Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the
spell's name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components,
and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell's effect.

Casting Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a
bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.

Bonus Action
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a
bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven't
already taken a bonus action this turn. You can't cast another spell
during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1
action.

Reactions
^^^^^^^^^

Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a
second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell
can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when
you can do so.

Longer Casting Times
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to
cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time
longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each
turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while
you do so (see "Concentration" below). If your concentration is broken,
the spell fails, but you don't expend a spell slot. If you want to try
casting the spell again, you must start over.

Range
~~~~~

The target of a spell must be within the spell's range. For a spell like
:ref:`srd:magic-missile`, the target is a creature. For a spell like :ref:`srd:fireball`,
the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.

Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a
creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the
:ref:`srd:shield` spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also
have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell's
effect must be you (see "Areas of Effect" below).

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren't limited by its range, unless
the spell's description says otherwise.

Components
~~~~~~~~~~

A spell's components are the physical requirements you must meet in
order to cast it. Each spell's description indicates whether it requires
verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can't
provide one or more of a spell's components, you are unable to cast the
spell.

Verbal (V)
^^^^^^^^^^

Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves
aren't the source of the spell's power; rather, the particular
combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the
threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an
area of silence, such as one created by the :ref:`srd:silence` spell, can't cast
a spell with a verbal component.

Somatic (S)
^^^^^^^^^^^

Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an
intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the
caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these
gestures.

Material (M)
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in
parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a **component
pouch** or a **spellcasting focus** (found in "Equipment") in place of
the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a
component, a character must have that specific component before he or
she can cast the spell.

If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell,
the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.

A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell's material
components---or to hold a spellcasting focus---but it can be the same hand
that he or she uses to perform somatic components.

Duration
~~~~~~~~

A spell's duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration
can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells
specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or
destroyed.

Instantaneous
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or
alters a creature or an object in a way that can't be dispelled, because
its magic exists only for an instant.

Concentration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their
magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in
its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate
on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn't interfere with
concentration. The following factors can break concentration:

-  **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose
   concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires
   concentration. You can't concentrate on two spells at once.

-  **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are
   concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw
   to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage
   you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from
   multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon's breath, you make a
   separate saving throw for each source of damage.

-  **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a spell
   if you are :ref:`srd:incapacitated` or if you die.

The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a
wave crashing over you while you're on a storm-tossed ship, require you
to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain
concentration on a spell.

Targets
~~~~~~~

A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected
by the spell's magic. A spell's description tells you whether the spell
targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect
(described below).

Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it
was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is
obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a
creature's thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says
otherwise.

A Clear Path to the Target
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can't be
behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can't see and an
obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of
origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.

Targeting Yourself
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself,
unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other
than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can
target yourself.

Areas of Effect
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spells such as :ref:`srd:burning-hands` and :ref:`srd:cone-of-cold` cover an area,
allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

A spell's description specifies its area of effect, which typically has
one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere.
Every area of effect has a **point of origin**, a location from which
the spell's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you
position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in
space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an
object.

A spell's effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If
no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a
location within the area of effect, that location isn't included in the
spell's area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must
provide total cover.

.. _srd:cone:

Cone
^^^^

A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A
cone's width at a given point along its length is equal to that point's
distance from the point of origin. A cone's area of effect specifies its
maximum length.

A cone's point of origin is not included in the cone's area of effect,
unless you decide otherwise.

.. _srd:sphere:

Sphere
^^^^^^

You select a sphere's point of origin, and the sphere extends outward
from that point. The sphere's size is expressed as a radius in feet that
extends from the point.

A sphere's point of origin is included in the sphere's area of effect.

.. _srd:cube:

Cube
^^^^

You select a cube's point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of
the cubic effect. The cube's size is expressed as the length of each
side.

A cube's point of origin is not included in the cube's area of effect,
unless you decide otherwise.

.. _srd:cylinder:

Cylinder
^^^^^^^^

A cylinder's point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular
radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on
the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a
cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the
perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell's
effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance
equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder's point of origin is included in the cylinder's area of
effect.

.. _srd:line:

Line
^^^^

A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its
length and covers an area defined by its width.

A line's point of origin is not included in the line's area of effect,
unless you decide otherwise.

Saving Throws
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some
or all of a spell's effects. The spell specifies the ability that the
target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability
modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.

Attack Rolls
~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Spell attacks (just as all other attacks) can score critical hits.

:has-official:`Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine
whether the spell effect hits the intended target.` Your attack bonus
with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your
proficiency bonus.

Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember
that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5
feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn't
:ref:`srd:incapacitated`.

Combining Magical Effects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The effects of different spells add together while the durations of
those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times
don't combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect---such as the
highest bonus---from those castings applies while their durations overlap.

For example, if two clerics cast :ref:`srd:bless` on the same target, that
character gains the spell's benefit only once; he or she doesn't get to
roll two bonus dice.
