Blade Barrier
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor sharp blades made of
magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the
duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet
high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20
feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three quarters cover to
creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the wall's area for the first time on a turn or
starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a
successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
