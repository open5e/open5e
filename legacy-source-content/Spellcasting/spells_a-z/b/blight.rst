Blight
-------------------------------------------------------------

4th-level necromancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can
see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target
must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving
throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.

If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature, such as a tree
or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
4th.
