Legend Lore
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level divination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (incense worth at least 250 gp, which the spell
consumes, and four ivory strips worth at least 50 gp each)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your
mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named.
The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even
secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named
isn't of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more
information you already have about the thing, the more precise and
detailed the information you receive is.

The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative
language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the
spell might yield this information: "Woe to the evildoer whose hand
touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones.
Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the
true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg on the
lips."
