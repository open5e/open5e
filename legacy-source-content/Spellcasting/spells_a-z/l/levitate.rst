Levitate
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (either a small leather loop or a piece of
golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

One creature or object of your choice that you can see within range
rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the
duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds.
An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is
unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or
surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to
move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up
to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you
can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your
action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is
still aloft.
