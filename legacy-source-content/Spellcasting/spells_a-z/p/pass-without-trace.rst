Pass without Trace
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of mistletoe and a
sprig of spruce)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your
companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose
within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity
(Stealth) checks and can't be tracked except by magical means. A
creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other
traces of its passage.
