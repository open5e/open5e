Prismatic Wall
-------------------------------------------------------------

9th-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque
wall---up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick---centered on a
point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall
into a :ref:`srd:sphere` up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose
within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you
position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a
creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are
wasted.

The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light for
an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the time you
cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall without harm.
If another creature that can see the wall moves to within 20 feet of it
or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw or become :ref:`srd:blinded` for 1 minute.

The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a
creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one
layer at a time through all the wall's layers. As it passes or reaches
through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or
be affected by that layer's properties as described below.

The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red
to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed,
it remains so for the duration of the spell. A rod of cancellation
destroys a prismatic wall, but an antimagic field has no effect on it.

**1. Red.** The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in place,
nonmagical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer can be
destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.

**2. Orange.** The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in
place, magical ranged attacks can't pass through the wall. The layer is
destroyed by a strong wind.

**3. Yellow.** The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be
destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.

**4. Green.** The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another
spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid
surface, destroys this layer.

**5. Blue.** The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be destroyed by
dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.

**6. Indigo.** On a failed save, the creature is :ref:`srd:restrained`. It must
then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails its
save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the
:ref:`srd:petrified` condition. The successes and failures don't need to be
consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects three of a
kind.

While this layer is in place, spells can't be cast
through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a
daylight spell or a similar spell of equal
or higher level.

**7. Violet.** On a failed save, the creature is :ref:`srd:blinded`. It must then
make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful
save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is
transported to another plane of the GM's choosing and is no longer
:ref:`srd:blinded`. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't its home
plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually cast into the
Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed by a dispel magic
spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells
and magical effects.
