Prestidigitation
-------------------------------------------------------------

Transmutation cantrip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Up to 1 hour

This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for
practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

-  You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a
   shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd
   odor.
-  You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small
   campfire.
-  You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic
   foot.
-  You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material
   for 1 hour.
-  You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a
   surface for 1 hour.
-  You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in
   your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its
non instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an
effect as an action.
