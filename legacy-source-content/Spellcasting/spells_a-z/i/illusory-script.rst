Illusory Script
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level illusion (ritual)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** S, M (a lead based ink worth at least 10 gp, which the
spell consumes)

**Duration:** 10 days

You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material
and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration.

To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the
writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever
meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing
appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is
unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be
an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language,
though the language must be one you know.

Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both
disappear.

A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.
