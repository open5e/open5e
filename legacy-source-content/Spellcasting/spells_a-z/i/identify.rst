1st-level divination (ritual)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and an owl
feather)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the
spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic imbued object, you
learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement
to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any
spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created
by a spell, you learn which spell created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what
spells, if any, are currently affecting it.
