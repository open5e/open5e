Imprisonment
-------------------------------------------------------------

9th-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the
likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to
the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die
of the target)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see
within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you
cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn't need
to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Divination spells can't
locate or perceive the target.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of
imprisonment.

**Burial.** The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a :ref:`srd:sphere`
of magical force that is just large enough to contain the target.
Nothing can pass through the :ref:`srd:sphere`, nor can any creature teleport or
use planar travel to get into or out of it.

The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral
orb.

**Chaining.** Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the ground, hold the
target in place. The target is :ref:`srd:restrained` until the spell ends, and it
can't move or be moved by any means until then.

The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of
precious metal.

**Hedged Prison.** The spell transports the target into a tiny
demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The
demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined
structure or area of your choice.

The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature
representation of the prison made from jade.

**Minimus Containment.** The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and
is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass
through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other
creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means
of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can't be cut or broken
while the spell remains in effect.

The special component for this version of the spell is a large,
transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.

**Slumber.** The target falls asleep and can't be awoken. The special
component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific
herbs.

**Ending the Spell.** During the casting of the spell, in any of its
versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end
and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate
as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable
and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a
creature's name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on
observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as
level, class, or hit points.

A dispel magic spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a 9th level
spell, targeting either the prison or the special component used to
create it.

You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at
a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target
of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.
