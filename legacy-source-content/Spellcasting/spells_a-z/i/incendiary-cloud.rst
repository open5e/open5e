Incendiary Cloud
-------------------------------------------------------------

8th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white hot embers appears in
a 20 foot radius :ref:`srd:sphere` centered on a point within range. The cloud
spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the
duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles
per hour) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving
throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving
throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or
ends its turn there.

The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you
choose at the start of each of your turns.
