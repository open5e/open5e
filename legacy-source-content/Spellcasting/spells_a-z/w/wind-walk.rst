Wind Walk
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (fire and holy water)

**Duration:** 8 hours

You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a
gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in
this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has
resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a
creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its
normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is
:ref:`srd:incapacitated` and can't move. Until the spell ends, a creature can
revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1 minute transformation.

If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the
creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which
it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, the creature falls the
remaining distance.
