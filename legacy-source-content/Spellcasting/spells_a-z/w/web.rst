Web
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice
within range. The webs fill a 20 foot :ref:`srd:cube` from that point for the
duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.

If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or
trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web
collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn.
Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them
during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature is :ref:`srd:restrained` as long as it remains in the webs or until it
breaks free.

A creature :ref:`srd:restrained` by the webs can use its action to make a Strength
check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer
:ref:`srd:restrained`.

The webs are flammable. Any 5 foot :ref:`srd:cube` of webs exposed to fire burns
away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its
turn in the fire.
