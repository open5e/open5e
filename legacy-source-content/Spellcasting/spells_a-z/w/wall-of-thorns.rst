Wall of Thorns
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a handful of thorns)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle
sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts
for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10
feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20 foot diameter and
is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing
damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For
every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of
movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a
turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving
throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th
level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot
level above 6th.
