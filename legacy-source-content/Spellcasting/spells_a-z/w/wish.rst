Wish
-------------------------------------------------------------

9th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply
speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord
with your desires.

The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level
or lower. You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell,
including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.

Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your
choice:

-  You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic
   item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and
   it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.
-  You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit
   points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater
   restoration spell.
-  You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage
   type you choose.
-  You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell
   or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make
   yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's life drain
   attack.
-  You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made
   within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes
   itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could
   undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a
   friend's failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with
   advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the
   reroll or the original roll.
-  You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above
   examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM
   has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the
   greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes
   wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only
   be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence
   as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a
   villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when
   that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the
   game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might
   instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.

The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than
duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each
time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10
necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can't be reduced or
prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn't
3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend
resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining
recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance
that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress.
