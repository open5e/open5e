Word of Recall
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 5 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly
teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures
that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the
spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you
cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no
effect.

You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location,
such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you
attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn't dedicated
to your deity, the spell has no effect.
