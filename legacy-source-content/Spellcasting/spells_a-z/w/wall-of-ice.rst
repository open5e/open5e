Wall of Ice
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form
it into a hemispherical dome or a :ref:`srd:sphere` with a radius of up to 10 feet,
or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10 foot square panels.
Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall
is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the
creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make
a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold
damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC
12 and 30 hit points per 10 foot section, and it is vulnerable to fire
damage. Reducing a 10 foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it
and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.
A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on
a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6
cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th
level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears increases by
2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air
increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.
