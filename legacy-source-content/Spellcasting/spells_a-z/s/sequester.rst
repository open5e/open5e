Sequester
-------------------------------------------------------------

7th-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby,
and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden
away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and
touch the target, it becomes :ref:`srd:invisible` and can't be targeted by
divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by
divination spells.

If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended
animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn't grow older.

You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be
anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of
the target. Examples include "after 1,000 years" or "when the tarrasque
awakens." This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.
