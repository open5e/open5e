Shapechange
-------------------------------------------------------------

9th-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which
you must place on your head before you cast the spell)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new
form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level
or lower. The creature can't be a construct or an undead, and you must
have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an
average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the
Spellcasting trait.

Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen
creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw
proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the
creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its
statistics is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus in place of
yours. You can't use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new
form.

You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you revert
to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had
before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit
points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as
the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you
aren't knocked :ref:`srd:unconscious`.

You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other
source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically
capable of doing so. You can't use any special senses you have (for
example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can
only speak if the creature can normally speak.

When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the
ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment
functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the
new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and
size. Your equipment doesn't change shape or size to match the new form,
and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the
ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect
in that state.

During this spell's duration, you can use your action to assume a
different form following the same restrictions and rules for the
original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points
than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.
