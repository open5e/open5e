Transmutation cantrip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or
quarterstaff)

**Duration:** 1 minute

The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with
nature's power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability
instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks
using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. The weapon
also becomes magical, if it isn't already. The spell ends if you cast it
again or if you let go of the weapon.
