Simulacrum
-------------------------------------------------------------

7th-level illusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 12 hours

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to made a
life size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail
clippings, or other piece of that creature's body placed inside the snow
or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate
and consumed by the spell)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within
range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a
creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take
actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be
the same as the original, but it has half the creature's hit point
maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion
uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates.

The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys
your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with your wishes
and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the ability to
learn or become more powerful, so it never increases its level or other
abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.

If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical
laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it
regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which
point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.

If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you
created with this spell are instantly destroyed.
