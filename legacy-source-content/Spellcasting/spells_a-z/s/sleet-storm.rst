Sleet Storm
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20 foot tall
:ref:`srd:cylinder` with a 40 foot radius centered on a point you choose within
range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area are
doused.

The ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it difficult
terrain. When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a
turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On
a failed save, it falls :ref:`srd:prone`.

If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area, the creature must
make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC
or lose concentration.
