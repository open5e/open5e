Spike Growth
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each
sharpened to a point)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The ground in a 20 foot radius centered on a point within range twists
and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain
for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it
takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any
creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make
a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the
terrain as hazardous before entering it.
