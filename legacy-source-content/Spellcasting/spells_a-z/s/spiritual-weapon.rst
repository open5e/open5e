Spiritual Weapon
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the
duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell,
you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of
the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your
spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet
and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are
associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his
mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that
weapon.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels
above 2nd.
