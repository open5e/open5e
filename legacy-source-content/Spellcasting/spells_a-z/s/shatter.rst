Shatter
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of
your choice within range. Each creature in a 10 foot radius :ref:`srd:sphere`
centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature
takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone,
crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the
damage if it's in the spell's area.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
2nd.
