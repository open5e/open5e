Slow
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of molasses)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40 foot
:ref:`srd:cube` within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and
Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can
use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the
creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee
or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1
action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect
until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on
that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.

A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at
the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.
