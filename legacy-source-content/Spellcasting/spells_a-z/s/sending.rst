Sending
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Unlimited

**Components:** V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire)

**Duration:** 1 round

You send a short message of twenty five words or less to a creature with
which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind,
recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like
manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores
of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of
existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is
a 5 percent chance that the message doesn't arrive.
