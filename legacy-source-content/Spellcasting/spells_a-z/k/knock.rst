Knock
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a
door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object
that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred
becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple
locks, only one of them is unlocked.

If you choose a target that is held shut with arcane lock, that spell is
suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened
and shut normally.

When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible from as far away as 300
feet, emanates from the target object.
