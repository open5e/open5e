Fear
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level illusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (30 foot :ref:`srd:cone`)

**Components:** V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a hen)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each
creature in a 30 foot :ref:`srd:cone` must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop
whatever it is holding and become :ref:`srd:frightened` for the duration.

While :ref:`srd:frightened` by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and
move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns,
unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a
location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can
make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for
that creature.
