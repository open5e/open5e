Flame Blade
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (leaf of sumac)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size
and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of
the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus
action.

You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery
blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage.

The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10 foot radius and dim light
for an additional 10 feet.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels
above 2nd.
