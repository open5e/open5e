Fire Shield
-------------------------------------------------------------

4th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)

**Duration:** 10 minutes

Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding
bright light in a 10 foot radius and dim light for an additional 10
feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you
choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and the
chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a
melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire
damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.
