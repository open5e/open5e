Finger of Death
-------------------------------------------------------------

7th-level necromancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see
within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a
Constitution saving throw. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as
a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal
orders to the best of its ability.
