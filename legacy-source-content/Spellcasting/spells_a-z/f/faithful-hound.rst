Faithful Hound
-------------------------------------------------------------

4th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a
thread)

**Duration:** 8 hours

You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see
within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as
an action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.

The hound is :ref:`srd:invisible` to all creatures except you and can't be harmed.
When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first
speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the
hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees :ref:`srd:invisible` creatures and can
see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.

At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one
creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound's attack
bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency
bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.
