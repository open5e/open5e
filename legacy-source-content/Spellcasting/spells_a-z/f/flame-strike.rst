**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Components:** V, S, M (pinch of sulfur)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a
location you specify. Each creature in a 10 foot radius, 40 foot high

failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th
level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice)
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
