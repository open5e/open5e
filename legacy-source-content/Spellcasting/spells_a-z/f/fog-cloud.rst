Fog Cloud
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a 20 foot radius :ref:`srd:sphere` of fog centered on a point within
range. The :ref:`srd:sphere` spreads around corners, and its area is heavily
obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or
greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd
level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each
slot level above 1st.
