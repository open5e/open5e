Enlarge/Reduce
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow
larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an
object that is neither

worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution
saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.

If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying
changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns
to normal size at once.

**Enlarge.** The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its
weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one
category---from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room
for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the
maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the
target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these
weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 extra
damage.

**Reduce.** The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its
weight is reduced to one eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its
size by one category---from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell
ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength
saving throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size.
While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4
less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).
