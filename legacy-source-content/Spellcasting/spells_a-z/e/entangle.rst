Entangle
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20 foot square
starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn
the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

A creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a
Strength saving throw or be :ref:`srd:restrained` by the entangling plants until
the spell ends. A creature :ref:`srd:restrained` by the plants can use its action
to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it
frees itself.

When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.
