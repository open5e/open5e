Eyebite
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level necromancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the spell's duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with
dread power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you
can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of
the following effects of your choice for the duration. On each of your
turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to target another
creature but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a
saving throw against this casting of eyebite.

**Asleep.** The target falls :ref:`srd:unconscious`. It wakes up if it takes any
damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper
awake.

**Panicked.** The target is :ref:`srd:frightened` of you. On each of its turns,
the :ref:`srd:frightened` creature must take the Dash action and move away from you
by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to
move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you
where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.

**Sickened.** The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability
checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom
saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.
