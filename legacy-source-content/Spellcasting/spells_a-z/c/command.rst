Command
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level enchantment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** 1 round

You speak a one word command to a creature you can see within range. The
target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on
its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it
doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful
to it.

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a
command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines
how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the
spell ends.

**Approach.** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most
direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

**Drop.** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

**Flee.** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the
fastest available means.

**Grovel.** The target falls :ref:`srd:prone` and then ends its turn.

**Halt.** The target doesn't move and takes no actions.

A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it
must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain
in the air.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd
level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot
level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when
you target them.
