Charm Person
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level enchantment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet 

**Components**: V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a
Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your
companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is :ref:`srd:charmed`
by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything
harmful to it. The :ref:`srd:charmed` creature regards you as a friendly
acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was :ref:`srd:charmed` by
you.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd
level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot
level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when
you target them.
