Chain Lightning
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a
crystal rod; and three silver pins)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice
that you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to
as many as three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of
the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be
targeted by only one of the bolts.

A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8
lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th
level or higher, one additional bolt leaps from the first target to
another target for each slot level above 6th.
