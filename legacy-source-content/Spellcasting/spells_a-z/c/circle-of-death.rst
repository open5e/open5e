Circle of Death
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level necromancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (the powder of a crushed black pearl worth at
least 500 gp)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A :ref:`srd:sphere` of negative energy ripples out in a 60 foot radius :ref:`srd:sphere` from
a point within range. Each creature in that area must make a
Constitution saving throw. A target takes 8d6 necrotic damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th
level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above
6th.
