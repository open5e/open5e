Creation
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level illusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type of the
item you plan to create)

**Duration:** Special

You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a
nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope,
wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create
mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created
must be no larger than a 5 foot :ref:`srd:cube`, and the object must be of a form
and material that you have seen before.

The duration depends on the object's material. If the object is composed
of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.

Material Duration

Vegetable matter 1 day

Stone or crystal 12 hours

Precious metals 1 hour

Gems 10 minutes

Adamantine or mithral 1 minute

Using any material created by this spell as another spell's material
component causes that spell to fail.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a

spell slot of 6th level or higher, the :ref:`srd:cube` increases by 5 feet for each
slot level above 5th.
