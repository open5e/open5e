Cloudkill
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a 20 foot radius :ref:`srd:sphere` of poisonous, yellow green fog
centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around
corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the
fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or
starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving
throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they
hold their breath or don't need to breathe.

The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns,
rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than
air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
5th.
