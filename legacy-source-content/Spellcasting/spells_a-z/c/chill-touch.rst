Chill Touch
-------------------------------------------------------------

Necromancy cantrip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 round

You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within
range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with
the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage,
and it can't regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until
then, the hand clings to the target.

If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls
against you until the end of your next turn.

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8),
11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
