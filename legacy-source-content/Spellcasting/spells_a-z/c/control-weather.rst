8th-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Self (5 mile radius)

**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood
mixed in water)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration.
You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you
don't have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.

When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions,
which are determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You can
change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes
for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change
the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns
to normal.

When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the
following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing
the wind, you can change its direction.
