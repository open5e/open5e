5th-level divination (ritual)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or unholy water)

**Duration:** 1 minute

You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions
that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions
before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.

Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you might receive
"unclear" as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies
beyond the deity's knowledge. In a case where a one word answer could be
misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the GM might offer a
short phrase as an answer instead.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long
rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the
first that you get no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret.
