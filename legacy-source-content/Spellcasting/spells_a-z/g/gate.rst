Gate
-------------------------------------------------------------

9th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within
range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The
portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in
diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The
portal lasts for the duration.

The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel
through the portal is possible only by moving through its front.
Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane,
appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.

Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this
spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.

When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature
(a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn't work). If that creature is on a
plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named
creature's immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the
nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special
power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems
appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.
