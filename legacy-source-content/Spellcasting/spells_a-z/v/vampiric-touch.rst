Vampiric Touch
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level necromancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The touch of your shadow wreathed hand can siphon life force from others
to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within
your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you
regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your
turns as an action.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
3rd.
