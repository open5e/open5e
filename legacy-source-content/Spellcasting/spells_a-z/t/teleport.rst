Teleport
-------------------------------------------------------------

7th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of
your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you
can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an
object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10 foot :ref:`srd:cube`, and it
can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the
same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination
determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and
consults the table.

**Familiarity.** "Permanent circle" means a permanent teleportation
circle whose sigil sequence you know. "Associated object" means that you
possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six
months, such as a book from a wizard's library, bed linen from a royal
suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich's secret tomb.

"Very familiar" is a place you have been very often, a place you have
carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. "Seen
casually" is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you
aren't very familiar. "Viewed once" is a place you have seen once,
possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose location and
appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a
map.

"False destination" is a place that doesn't exist.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an
illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that
no longer exists.

**On Target.** You and your group (or the target object) appear where
you want to.

**Off Target.** You and your group (or the target object) appear a
random distance away from the destination in a random direction.
Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to
be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off
target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off
target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off
target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as
northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you
were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you
could be in trouble.

**Similar Area.** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in
a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target
area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you
might wind up in another wizard's laboratory or in an alchemical supply
shop that has many of the same tools and implements as your laboratory.
Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell
has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.

**Mishap.** The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult
journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10
force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up
(multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).
