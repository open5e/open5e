Haste
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell
ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has
advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action
on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack
(one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object
action.

When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after
its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
