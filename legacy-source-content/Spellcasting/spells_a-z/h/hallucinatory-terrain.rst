Hallucinatory Terrain
-------------------------------------------------------------

4th-level illusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 300 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You make natural terrain in a 150 foot :ref:`srd:cube` in range look, sound, and
smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a
road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other
difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a
grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock strewn gully
like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and
creatures within the area aren't changed in appearance.

The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures
entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the
difference isn't obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the
illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for
what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.
