6th-level necromancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other
ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters
the container you used for the spell's material component. While your
soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if
you were in the container's space. You can't move or use reactions. The
only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of
the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the
spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.

You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you
can see (creatures warded by a protection from evil and good or magic
circle spell can't be possessed). The target must make a Charisma saving
throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target's body, and the
target's soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the target
resists your efforts to possess it, and you can't attempt to possess it
again for 24 hours.

Once you possess a creature's body, you control it. Your game statistics
are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your
alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain
the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class
levels, you can't use any of its class features.

Meanwhile, the possessed creature's soul can perceive from the container
using its own senses, but it can't move or take actions at all.

While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host
body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the
host creature's soul to its body. If the host body dies while you're in
it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against
your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if
it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.

If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately
returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you
or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If
another creature's soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the
creature's soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100
feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.

When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.
