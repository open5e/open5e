Magic Circle
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron worth at
least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 1 hour

You create a 10 foot radius, 20 foot tall :ref:`srd:cylinder` of magical energy
centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing
runes appear wherever the :ref:`srd:cylinder` intersects with the floor or other
surface.

Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials,
elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the
chosen type in the following ways:

The creature can't willingly enter the :ref:`srd:cylinder` by nonmagical means. If
the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so,
it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.

The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the
:ref:`srd:cylinder`.

Targets within the :ref:`srd:cylinder` can't be :ref:`srd:charmed`, :ref:`srd:frightened`, or possessed
by the creature.

When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in
the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from
leaving the :ref:`srd:cylinder` and protecting targets outside it.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th
level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level
above 3rd.
