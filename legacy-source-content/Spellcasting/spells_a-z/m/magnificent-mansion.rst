Magnificent Mansion
-------------------------------------------------------------

7th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 300 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small
piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at
least 5 gp)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the
duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance
shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any
creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the
extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can
open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed,
the portal is invisible.

Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond.
The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can't exceed 50
:ref:`cubes <srd:cube>`, each :ref:`srd:cube` being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and
decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine
course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100 near transparent
servants attends all who enter. You decide the visual appearance of
these servants and their attire. They are completely obedient to your
orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could
perform, but they can't attack or take any action that would directly
harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend,
fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The
servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can't leave it. Furnishings
and other objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed
from the mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the
extradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to the
entrance.
