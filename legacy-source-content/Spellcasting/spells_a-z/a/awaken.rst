Awaken
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 8 hours

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the
spell consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a
precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The
target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or
less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the
ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it
gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so
forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. Your GM chooses
statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics
for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.

The awakened beast or plant is :ref:`srd:charmed` by you for 30 days or until you
or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the :ref:`srd:charmed` condition
ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you,
based on how you treated it while it was :ref:`srd:charmed`.
