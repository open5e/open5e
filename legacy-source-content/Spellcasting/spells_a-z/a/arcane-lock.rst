Arcane Lock
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell
consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it
becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate
when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set
a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses
this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken
or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting knock on the object
suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes.

While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or
force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.
