Arcanist's Magic Aura
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level illusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a small square of silk)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that
divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a
willing creature or an object that isn't being carried or worn by
another creature.

When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects.
The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same
creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it
each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.

**False Aura.** You change the way the target appears to spells and
magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You
can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear
nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that it appears to
belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this
effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any
creature that handles the item.

**Mask.** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical
effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin's Divine Sense or
the trigger of a symbol spell. You choose a creature type and other
spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of
that type or of that alignment.
