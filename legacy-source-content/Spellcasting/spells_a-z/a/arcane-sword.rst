Arcane Sword
-------------------------------------------------------------

7th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and
pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a sword shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It
lasts for the duration.

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target
of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes
3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on
each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see
and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.
