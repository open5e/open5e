Antipathy/Sympathy
-------------------------------------------------------------

8th-level enchantment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the
antipathy effect or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect)

**Duration:** 10 days

This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target
something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or
an area that is no larger than a 200 foot :ref:`srd:cube`. Then specify a kind of
intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You
invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the
specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as
the aura's effect.

**Antipathy.** The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you
designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the
target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet
of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
:ref:`srd:frightened`. The creature remains :ref:`srd:frightened` while it can see the target
or is within 60 feet of it. While :ref:`srd:frightened` by the target, the creature
must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it
can't see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the
target and can't see it, the creature is no longer :ref:`srd:frightened`, but the
creature becomes :ref:`srd:frightened` again if it regains sight of the target or
moves within 60 feet of it.

**Sympathy.** The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel
an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or
able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within
60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use
its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach
of the target. When the creature has done so, it can't willingly move
away from the target.

If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the
affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as
described below.

**Ending the Effect.** If an affected creature ends its turn while not
within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a
Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer
affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or
attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is
allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell
persists.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it
for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.
