Dispel Evil and Good
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and
creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration,
celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on
attack rolls against you.

You can end the spell early by using either of the following special
functions.

**Break Enchantment.** As your action, you touch a creature you can
reach that is :ref:`srd:charmed`, :ref:`srd:frightened`, or possessed by a celestial, an
elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you touch is no
longer :ref:`srd:charmed`, :ref:`srd:frightened`, or possessed by such creatures.

**Dismissal.** As your action, make a melee spell attack against a
celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On
a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The
creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its
home plane (if it isn't there already). If they aren't on their home
plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the
Feywild.
