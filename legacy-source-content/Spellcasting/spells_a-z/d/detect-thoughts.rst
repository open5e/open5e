Detect Thoughts
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level divination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a copper piece)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When
you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends,
you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30
feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or
lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature---what is most on
its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your
attention to another creature's thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into
the same creature's mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a
Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning
(if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its
mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it
succeeds, the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are
probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another
creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make
an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it
succeeds, the spell ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the
course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part
of an interrogation.

You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures
you can't see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the
duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell
can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other
than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can't detect a
creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak
any language.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its
thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you
can't see it, but it must still be within range.
