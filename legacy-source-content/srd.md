Races
=====

### Racial Traits

The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to
members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of
most races.

#### Ability Score Increase

Every race increases one or more of a character’s ability scores.

#### Age

The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an
adult, as well as the race’s expected lifespan. This information can
help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You
can choose any age for your character, which could provide an
explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a
young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low
Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a
high Intelligence or Wisdom.

#### Alignment

Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this
entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why
your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society
can help you better define your character.

#### Size

Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures
that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small
(between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game
affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small
characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in
“Equipment.”

#### Speed

Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (
“Adventuring”) and fighting (“Combat”).

#### Languages

By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write
certain languages.

#### Subraces

Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the
parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace.
Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and
world to world.

> **Dwarf**

### Dwarf Traits

Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and
parcel of dwarven nature.

> ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they’re
considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live
about 350 years.

***Alignment.*** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the
benefits of a well-­‐‑ordered society. They tend toward good as well,
with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to
share in the benefits of a just order.

***Size.*** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about
150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not
reduced by wearing heavy armor.

> ***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underground, you

have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim
light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness
as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray.

***Dwarven Resilience.*** You have advantage on saving throws against
poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

> ***Dwarven Combat Training.*** You have proficiency with the
> battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.

***Tool Proficiency.*** You gain proficiency with the artisan’s tools of
your choice: smith’s tools, brewer’s supplies, or mason’s tools.

***Stonecunning.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check
related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the
History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check,
instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish.
Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those
characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might
speak.

#### Hill Dwarf

As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable
resilience.

> ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

***Dwarven Toughness.*** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it
increases by 1 every time you gain a level.

Elf
---

### Elf Traits

Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of
thousands of years of elven refinement.

> ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age
as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical
growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims
adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750
years old.

***Alignment.*** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-­‐‑ expression,
so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value
and protect others’ freedom as well as their own, and they are more
often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile has made
them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.

***Size.*** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have
slender builds. Your size is Medium.

> ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you
have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim
light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness
as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray.

> ***Keen Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being
charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

***Trance.*** Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply,
remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such
meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a
fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become
reflexive through years of practice.

After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does
from 8 hours of sleep.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish.
Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven
literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous
among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add
Elvish ballads to their repertoires.

#### High Elf

As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics
of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high
elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be
superior to non-­‐‑elves and even other elves. The other type is more
common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other
races.

> ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.
>
> ***Elf Weapon Training.*** You have proficiency with

the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

***Cantrip.*** You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell
list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

***Extra Language.*** You can speak, read, and write one extra language
of your choice.

Halfling
--------

### Halfling Traits

Your halfling character has a number of traits in common with all other
halflings.

> ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

***Age.*** A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally
lives into the middle of his or her second century.

***Alignment.*** Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are
good-­‐‑hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no
tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional,
leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of
their old ways.

***Size.*** Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40
pounds. Your size is Small.

> ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Lucky.*** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability
check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new
roll.

***Brave.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being
frightened.

> ***Halfling Nimbleness.*** You can move through the space of any
> creature that is of a size larger than yours.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The
Halfling language isn’t secret, but halflings are loath to share it with
others. They write very little, so they don’t have a rich body of
literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all
halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they
dwell or through which they are traveling.

#### Lightfoot

As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using
other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well
with others.

Lightfoots are more prone to wanderlust than other halflings, and often
dwell alongside other races or take up a nomadic life.

> ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 1.

***Naturally Stealthy.*** You can attempt to hide even when you are
obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

Human
-----

### Human Traits

It’s hard to make generalizations about humans, but your human character
has these traits.

> ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your ability scores each increase by 1.

***Age.*** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than
a century.

***Alignment.*** Humans tend toward no particular alignment. The best
and the worst are found among them.

***Size.*** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet
to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range,
your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. ***Languages.*** You
can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice.

Humans typically learn the languages of other

peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of
sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc
curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so
on.

Dragonborn
----------

### Dragonborn Traits

Your draconic heritage manifests in a variety of traits you share with
other dragonborn.

> ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and
> your Charisma score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Young dragonborn grow quickly. They walk hours after
hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-­‐‑year-­‐‑old human
child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around
80.

> ***Alignment.*** Dragonborn tend to extremes, making

a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between
good and evil. Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with evil
can be terrible villains.

***Size.*** Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well
over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds. Your size is Medium.

> ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

#### Draconic Ancestry

  | **Dragon**   | **Damage Type**   | **Breath Weapon**
  -------------- ------------------- --------------------------------
  | Black        | Acid              | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
  | Blue         | Lightning         | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
  | Brass        | Fire              | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
  | Bronze       | Lightning         | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
  | Copper       | Acid              | 5 by 30 ft. line (Dex. save)
  | Gold         | Fire              | 15 ft. cone (Dex. save)
  | Green        | Poison            | 15 ft. cone (Con. save)
  | Red          | Fire              | 15 ft. cone (Dex. save)
  | Silver       | Cold              | 15 ft. cone (Con. save)
  | White        | Cold              | 15 ft. cone (Con. save)

***Draconic Ancestry.*** You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of
dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage
resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.

***Breath Weapon.*** You can use your action to exhale destructive
energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage
type of the exhalation.

When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the
exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by
your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your
Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6
damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful

one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and
5d6 at 16th level.

After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you
complete a short or long rest.

> ***Damage Resistance.*** You have resistance to the

damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.
Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used
in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures
and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.

Gnome
-----

### Gnome Traits

Your gnome character has certain characteristics in common with all
other gnomes.

> ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2.
>
> ***Age.*** Gnomes mature at the same rate humans do,

and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age
40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.

***Alignment.*** Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law
are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or
inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters,
wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-­‐‑hearted, and even
the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.

***Size.*** Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40
pounds. Your size is Small.

> ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior
vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60
feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

> ***Gnome Cunning.*** You have advantage on all

Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Gnomish. The
Gnomish language, which uses the Dwarvish script, is renowned for its
technical treatises and its catalogs of knowledge about the natural
world.

#### Rock Gnome

As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond
that of other gnomes.

> ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Artificer’s Lore.*** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History)
check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or technological
devices, you can add twice your proficiency bonus, instead of any
proficiency bonus you normally apply.

***Tinker.*** You have proficiency with artisan’s tools (tinker’s
tools). Using those tools, you can spend 1 hour and 10 gp worth of
materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device
ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it
to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to
dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create
it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.

> When you create a device, choose one of the

following options:

> *Clockwork Toy.* This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person,
> such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the
> ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns
> in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature
> it represents.
>
> *Fire Starter.* The device produces a miniature flame, which you can
> use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires
> your action.
>
> *Music Box.* When opened, this music box plays a single song at a
> moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end
> or when it is closed.

Half-Elf
--------

some that are unique to half-­‐‑elves.

> ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and
> two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1.

***Age.*** Half-­‐‑elves mature at the same rate humans do and reach
adulthood around the age of 20. They live much longer than humans,
however, often exceeding 180 years.

> ***Alignment.*** Half-­‐‑elves share the chaotic bent of

their elven heritage. They value both personal freedom and creative
expression, demonstrating neither love of leaders nor desire for
followers. They chafe at rules, resent others’ demands, and

sometimes prove unreliable, or at least unpredictable.

***Size.*** Half-­‐‑elves are about the same size as humans, ranging
from 5 to 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

> ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in
dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you
as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You
can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being
charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.

> ***Skill Versatility.*** You gain proficiency in two skills of your
> choice.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common, Elvish, and one
extra language of your choice.

Half-Orc
--------

ancestry.

> ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Strength score increases by 2, and
> your Constitution score increases by 1.

***Age.*** Half-­‐‑orcs mature a little faster than humans, reaching
adulthood around age 14. They age noticeably faster and rarely live
longer than 75 years.

***Alignment.*** Half-­‐‑orcs inherit a tendency toward chaos from their
orc parents and are not strongly inclined toward good. Half-­‐‑orcs
raised among orcs and willing to live out their lives among them are
usually evil.

***Size.*** Half-­‐‑orcs are somewhat larger and bulkier than humans,
and they range from 5 to well over 6 feet tall. Your size is Medium.

> ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in
dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you

can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

> ***Menacing.*** You gain proficiency in the

Intimidation skill.

> ***Relentless Endurance.*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points but
> not killed outright, you can drop to 1

hit point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a
long rest.

***Savage Attacks.*** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon
attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time
and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Orc. Orc is a
harsh, grating language with hard consonants. It has no script of its
own but is written in the Dwarvish script.

Tiefling
--------

### Tiefling Traits

Tieflings share certain racial traits as a result of their infernal
descent.

> ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Intelligence score increases by 1,
> and your Charisma score increases by 2.

***Age.*** Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few
years longer.

***Alignment.*** Tieflings might not have an innate tendency toward
evil, but many of them end up there. Evil or not, an independent nature
inclines many tieflings toward a chaotic alignment.

***Size.*** Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your
size is Medium.

> ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior
vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60
feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were
dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

> ***Hellish Resistance.*** You have resistance to fire damage.

***Infernal Legacy.*** You know the *thaumaturgy* cantrip. When you
reach 3rd level, you can cast the *hellish rebuke* spell as a
2nd-­‐‑level spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so
when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the
*darkness* spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so
when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for
these spells.

> **Rage**

In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a
rage as a bonus action.

While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing
heavy armor:

-   You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

-   When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus
    > to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a
    > barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the
    > Barbarian table.

### Reckless Attack

Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to
attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack on your
turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage
on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this turn, but attack
rolls against you have advantage until your next turn.

### Danger Sense

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t as
they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

> You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws

against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this
benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.

### Primal Path

At 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage.
Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both
detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you
features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Fast Movement

Starting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren’t
wearing heavy armor.

### Feral Instinct

By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on
initiative rolls.

Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t
incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you
enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.

### Brutal Critical

Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage die
when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee
attack.

This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional
dice at 17th level.

### Relentless Rage

Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous
wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and don’t die
outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you
succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

> Each time you use this feature after the first, the

DC increases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets
to 10.

### Persistent Rage

Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early only
if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.

### Indomitable Might

Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less than
your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

### Primal Champion

At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and
Constitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now
24.

### Path of the Berserker

For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end— that end being violence.
The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with
blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of
battle, heedless of your own health or well-­‐‑being.

#### Frenzy

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a
frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage you
can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your
turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level of
exhaustion (as described in appendix A).

#### Mindless Rage

Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while raging.
If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is
suspended for the duration of the rage.

#### Intimidating Presence

Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone
with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that
you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you,
it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your
proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you
until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your
action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature
until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends
its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.

> If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you

can’t use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.

#### Retaliation

Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is
within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon
attack against that creature.

> **Spellcasting**
>
> You have learned to untangle and reshape the fabric of reality in
> harmony with your wishes and music.
>
> Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune
> to different situations.

#### Cantrips

You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn
additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in
the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.

#### Spell Slots

The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a
slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.

> For example, if you know the 1st-­‐‑level spell *cure*

*wounds* and have a 1st-­‐‑level and a 2nd-­‐‑level spell slot
available, you can cast *cure wounds* using either slot.

> **Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher** You know four 1st-­‐‑level
> spells of your choice from the bard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard
spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you
reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd
level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard
spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell
slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic
comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your
music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your
spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when
setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an
attack roll with one.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
> modifier
>
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
> modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the
ritual tag.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, “Equip-­‐‑ment”) as a
spellcasting focus for your bard spells.

### Bardic Inspiration

You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you
use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than
yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one
Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add
the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it
makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before
deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the
GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration
die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic
Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you
finish a long rest.

Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in
this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and
a d12 at 15th level.

### Jack of All Trades

Starting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded
down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your
proficiency bonus.

### Song of Rest

Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help
revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any
friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at
the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of
those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this
class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th
level.

### Bard College

At 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college
of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both
detailed at the end of

the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and
again at 6th and 14th level.

### Expertise

At 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency
bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the
chosen proficiencies.

At 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain
this benefit.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Font of Inspiration

Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses
of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.

### Countercharm

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of
power to disrupt mind-­‐‑influencing effects. As an action, you can
start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During
that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have
advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A
creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance
ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily
end it (no action required).

### Magical Secrets

By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum
of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A
spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard
table, or a cantrip.

The chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the
number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.

You learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again
at 18th level.

### Superior Inspiration

At 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic
Inspiration left, you regain one use.

### College of Lore

Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things,
collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes
and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate
compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold
audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members
might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from
their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to
the king.

The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not
in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who
keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would
rather be honest than politic.

> The college’s members gather in libraries and

sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories,
to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or
affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and
poke fun at self-­‐‑important figures of authority.

#### Bonus Proficiencies

When you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency
with three skills of your choice.

#### Cutting Words

Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse,
and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others. When a
creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an
ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one
of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and
subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose
to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM
determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails,
or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it
can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being charmed.

#### Additional Magical Secrets

At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A
spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard
table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but

don’t count against the number of bard spells you know.

#### Peerless Skill

Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend
one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the
number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you
roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether
you succeed or fail.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> **Spellcasting**
>
> As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.

#### Cantrips

> At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cleric
> spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your choice at
> higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric
> table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a
slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to
cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so, choose a
number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric
level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which
you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-­‐‑level cleric, you have four
1st-­‐‑level and two 2nd-­‐‑level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your
list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in
any combination. If you prepare the 1st-­‐‑level spell *cure wounds*,
you can cast it using a 1st-­‐‑level or 2nd-­‐‑level slot. Casting the
spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and
meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The power of
your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use your Wisdom
whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC
for a cleric spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
>
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
> modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag
and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a spellcasting
focus for your cleric spells.

### Divine Domain

Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature,
Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each

domain is detailed at the end of the class description, and each one
provides examples of gods associated with it. Your choice grants you
domain spells and other features when you choose it at 1st level. It
also grants you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you gain
that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th
levels.

#### Domain Spells

Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells— that you gain at the
cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once you gain a domain
spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the
number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell list,
the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

### Channel Divinity

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly
from your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start
with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your
domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in
levels, as noted in the domain description.

When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create.
You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity
again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such
an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.

> Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel

Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use
it three times between rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you
regain your expended uses.

#### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead

As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring
the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you
must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw,
it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from
you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of
you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the
Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
action.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Destroy Undead

Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against
your Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its
challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the
Destroy Undead table.

#### Destroy Undead

> **Cleric Level Destroys Undead of CR . . .**
>
> 5th 1/2 or lower

8th 1 or lower

> 11th 2 or lower
>
> 14th 3 or lower
>
> 17th 4 or lower

### Divine Intervention

Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your
behalf when your need is great.

Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the
assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number
equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The GM
chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell
or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.

If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days.
Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

> At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds

automatically, no roll required.

### Life Domain

The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the
fundamental forces of the universe—that sustains all life. The gods of
life promote vitality and health through healing the sick and wounded,
caring for those in need, and driving away the forces of death and
undeath. Almost any non-­‐‑evil deity can claim influence over this
domain, particularly agricultural deities (such as Chauntea, Arawai, and
Demeter), sun gods (such as Lathander, Pelor, and Re-­‐‑Horakhty), gods
of healing or

endurance (such as Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods
of home and community (such as Hestia, Hathor, and Boldrei).

#### Life Domain Spells

> **Cleric Level Spells**
>
> 1st *bless, cure wounds*
>
> 3rd *lesser restoration, spiritual weapon*
>
> 5th *beacon of hope, revivify*
>
> 7th *death ward, guardian of faith*
>
> 9th *mass cure wounds, raise dead*

#### Bonus Proficiency

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with
heavy armor.

#### Disciple of Life

Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective.
Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to
a creature, the creature regains additional hit points equal to 2 + the
spell’s level.

> **Channel Divinity: Preserve Life** Starting at 2nd level, you can use
> your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that
can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric
level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit
points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than
half of its hit point maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead
or a construct.

#### Blessed Healer

Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on others heal you
as well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit
points to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 +
the spell’s level.

#### Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with
divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a
weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant
damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
increases to 2d8.

#### Supreme Healing

Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to
restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number
possible for

each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a
creature, you restore 12.

### Spellcasting

> Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to
> shape that essence to your will.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell
list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher
levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must
expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.

> You prepare the list of druid spells that are

available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you
do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier +
your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level
for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a druidic focus (see chapter 5, “Equip-­‐‑ ment”) as a
spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

### Wild Shape

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the
shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature
twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown
in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform
into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t
have a flying or swimming speed.

#### Beast Shapes

**Max.**

> For example, if you are a 3rd-­‐‑level druid, you have
>
> **Level**
>
> **CR Limitations Example**

four 1st-­‐‑level and two 2nd-­‐‑level spell slots. With a

Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can

> 2nd 1/4 No flying or swimming speed
>
> Wolf

include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any

combination. If you prepare the 1st-­‐‑level spell *cure wounds,* you
can cast it using a 1st-­‐‑level or 2nd-­‐‑level slot. Casting the spell
doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer
and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your
magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your
Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC
for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
>
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
> modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag
and you have the spell prepared.

> 4th 1/2 No flying speed Crocodile
>
> 8th 1 — Giant

eagle

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your
druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless
you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal
form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically
revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

-   Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast,
    > but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence,
    > Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and
    > saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of
    > the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and
    > the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the
    > creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any
    > legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.

-   When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice.
    > When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of
    > hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert
    > as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries
    > over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in
    > animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you

> revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce
> your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.

-   You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action
    > that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your
    > beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a
    > spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking
    > actions that are part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that
    > you’ve already cast.

-   You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or
    > other source and can use them if the new form is physically
    > capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special
    > senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has
    > that sense.

-   You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space,
    > merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment
    > functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical
    > for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the
    > creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or
    > shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form
    > can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.
    > Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave
    > the form.

### Druid Circle

At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the Circle
of the Land or the Circle of the Moon, both detailed at the end of the
class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and
again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Timeless Body

Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to
age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1
year.

### Beast Spells

Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any
shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and
verbal

components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren’t able
to provide material components.

### Archdruid

At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your
druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and
aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal
shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.

### Circle of the Land

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard
ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids
meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal
secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members preside as the chief
priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors
to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is
influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s
mysterious rites.

#### Bonus Cantrip

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid
cantrip of your choice.

#### Natural Recovery

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by
sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest,
you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a
combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level
(rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You
can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-­‐‑level druid, you can recover up to
two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-­‐‑level
slot or two 1st-­‐‑level slots.

#### Circle Spells

Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to
cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to
circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose
that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or
swamp—and consult the associated list of spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and
it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell
list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

#### Land’s Stride

Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs
you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants
without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they
have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are
magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created
by the *entangle* spell.

#### Nature’s Ward

When you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by
elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

#### Nature’s Sanctuary

When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your
connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or
plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving
throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature
must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a
successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

> The creature is aware of this effect before it makes

its attack against you.

##### Sacred Plants and Wood

> A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash,
> birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow,
> and yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus,
> incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.
>
> Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as
> weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so
> weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it.
> Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make
> excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as
> well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used
> for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.
>
> Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen
> other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a
> desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.

##### Druids and the Gods

> Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids
> are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the
> multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix B include many such
> deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more
> ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.

>
> **Martial Arts**
>
> At 1st level, your practice of martial arts gives you mastery of

>
> You gain the following benefits while you are unarmed or wielding only
> monk weapons and you aren’t wearing armor or wielding a shield:

-   You can use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack and damage
    > rolls of your unarmed strikes and monk weapons.

-   You can roll a d4 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed
    > strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels,
    > as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.

-   When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk
    > weapon on your turn, you can

> make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take
> the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an
> unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a
> bonus action this turn.

Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For
example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a
short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter
blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can
use the game statistics provided for the weapon.

### Ki

Starting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the mystic
energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a number of
ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points you

### Unarmored Movement

Starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are not
wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when you reach
certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.

At 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces and
across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.

### Monastic Tradition

When you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic tradition:
the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four
Elements, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your
tradition grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and
17th level.

### Deflect Missiles

have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk

table.

You can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start
knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and Step
of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in this
class.

When you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a short or
long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your expended ki back
into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes of the rest meditating
to regain your ki points.

Some of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw to
resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as
follows:

> **Ki save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

#### Flurry of Blows

Immediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend
1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.

#### Patient Defense

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on
your turn.

#### Step of the Wind

You can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus
action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.

Starting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch the
missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the
damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your Dexterity
modifier + your monk level.

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small
enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one hand free.
If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki point to make a
ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition you just caught, as
part of the same reaction. You make this attack with proficiency,
regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the missile counts as a
monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal range of 20 feet and a
long range of 60 feet.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Slow Fall

Beginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to
reduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times your
monk level.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Stunning Strike

Starting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an
opponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon
attack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The
target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned until
the end of your next turn.

### Ki-Empowered Strikes

Starting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the
purpose of overcoming resistance

### Timeless Body

At 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the
frailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die
of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.

### Empty Body

Beginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki points to
become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also have
resistance to all damage but force damage.

Additionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the *astral projection*
spell, without needing material components. When you do so, you can’t
take any other creatures with you.

### Perfect Self

and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

> At 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have

### Evasion

At 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way of
certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or a
*fireball* spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to
make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take
no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if
you fail.

### Stillness of Mind

Starting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on
yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

### Purity of Body

At 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you
immune to disease and poison.

### Tongue of the Sun and Moon

Starting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so that
you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can
understand a language can understand what you say.

### Diamond Soul

Beginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency in
all saving throws.

> Additionally, whenever you make a saving throw

and fail, you can spend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second
result.

no ki points remaining, you regain 4 ki points.

Monastic Traditions
-------------------

Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries
scattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition
exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk
according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely
on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept.
Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.

### Way of the Open Hand

Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial
arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and
trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and
practice advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.

#### Open Hand Technique

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can manipulate
your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature
with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose
one of the following effects on that target:

-   It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

-   It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it
    > up to 15 feet away from you.

-   It can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.

#### Wholeness of Body

At 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action, you
can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must
finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

#### Tranquility

Beginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that
surrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain
the effect of a *sanctuary* spell that lasts until the start of your
next long rest (the spell can end early as normal). The saving throw DC
for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.

#### Quivering Palm

At 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in
someone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can
spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last
for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are
harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you and the
target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use this action,
the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is
reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.

You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a
time. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an
action.

### Lay on Hands

Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power
that replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can
restore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level

× 5.

As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to
restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum
amount remaining in your pool.

Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to
cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it.
You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a
single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each
one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

### Fighting Style

At 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty. Choose
one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option
more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons,
you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a
melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the
die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-­‐‑handed or
versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Protection

When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is
within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage
on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.

### Spellcasting

By 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through
meditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher, you
must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to
cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so, choose a
number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your
paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be
of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 5th-­‐‑level paladin, you have four
1st-­‐‑level and two 2nd-­‐‑level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14,
your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd
level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-­‐‑level spell *cure
wounds,* you can cast it using a 1st-­‐‑level or a 2nd-­‐‑ level slot.
Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and
meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since
their power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use your
Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw
DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
> modifier
>
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
> modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin
spells.

### Divine Smite

Starting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon
attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the
target, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for
a 1st-­‐‑level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level

higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the
target is an undead or a fiend.

### Divine Health

By 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune to
disease.

### Sacred Oath

When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin
forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed
to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of
Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all
detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and
20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity
feature.

#### Oath Spells

Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these
spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain
access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t
count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

If you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell list,
the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.

#### Channel Divinity

Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects.
Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use
it.

> When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose

which option to use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use
your Channel Divinity again.

Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such
an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell save DC.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Aura of Protection

Starting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10
feet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the
saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of
+1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

### Aura of Courage

Starting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you
can’t be frightened while you are conscious.

> At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30

feet.

### Improved Divine Smite

By 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your
melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a
creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant
damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this
damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite.

### Cleansing Touch

Beginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on
yourself or on one willing creature that you touch.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma
modifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a
long rest.

Sacred Oaths
------------

Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the
cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final
oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all
the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider
themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this
oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an
official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.

### Oath of Devotion

The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice,
virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy
warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor,
acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold
themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or
worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear
this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets
as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants
of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into
their helmets or coats of arms.

#### Tenets of Devotion

Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary,
paladins of this oath share these tenets.

***Honesty.*** Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.

> ***Courage.*** Never fear to act, though caution is wise.

***Compassion.*** Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who
threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.

***Honor.*** Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be
an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least
amount of harm.

***Duty.*** Be responsible for your actions and their consequences,
protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just
authority over you.

#### Oath Spells

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

#### Oath of Devotion Spells

> **Paladin**
>
> **Level Spells**
>
> 3rd *protection from evil and good, sanctuary*
>
> 5th *lesser restoration, zone of truth*
>
> 9th *beacon of hope, dispel magic*
>
> 13th *freedom of movement, guardian of faith*
>
> 17th *commune, flame strike*

#### Channel Divinity

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel
Divinity options.

***Sacred Weapon.*** As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are
holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute,
you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with

that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright
light in a 20-­‐‑foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the
weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you
are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall
unconscious, this effect ends.

***Turn the Unholy.*** As an action, you present your holy symbol and
speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity.
Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must
make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it
is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from
you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of
you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the
Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge
action.

#### Aura of Devotion

Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you
can’t be charmed while you are conscious.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

#### Purity of Spirit

> Beginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a
> *protection from evil and good* spell.

#### Holy Nimbus

At 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight. For 1
minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-­‐‑foot radius, and dim
light shines 30 feet beyond that.

Whenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the
creature takes 10 radiant damage.

In addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws
against spells cast by fiends or undead.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a
long rest.

##### Breaking Your Oath

> A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even
> the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves
> too demanding, sometimes a situation calls
>
> for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes
> a paladin to transgress his or her oath.
>
> A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a
> cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same
> order. The paladin might spend an all-­‐ night vigil in prayer as a
> sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of
> self-­‐denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin
> starts fresh.
>
> If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of
> repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s
> discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this
> class and adopt another.

### Natural Explorer

You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and
are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of
favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or
swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your
favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a
skill that you’re proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain
the following benefits:

-   Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.

-   Your group can’t become lost except by magical means.

-   Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such
    > as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.

-   If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a
    > normal pace.

-   When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.

-   While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number,
    > their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.

### Fighting Style

At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your
specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a
Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose
again.

#### Archery

You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.

#### Defense

While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling

When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons,
you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you engage in two-­‐‑weapon fighting, you can add your ability
modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Spellcasting

By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical
essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10
for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger
spell list.

#### Spell Slots

The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a
slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-­‐‑level spell *animal friendship* and
have a 1st-­‐‑level and a 2nd-­‐‑level spell slot available, you can
cast *animal friendship* using either slot.

> **Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher** You know two 1st-­‐‑level
> spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more
ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level
for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level
in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your
magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a
spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you
cast and when making an attack roll with one.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
>
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
> modifier

### Ranger Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter
or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your
choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th
level.

### Primeval Awareness

Beginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger
spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you. For 1
minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the
following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within
up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations,
celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature
doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever
you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Land’s Stride

Starting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs
you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants
without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they
have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are
magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created
by the *entangle* spell.

### Hide in Plain Sight

Starting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for
yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and
other naturally occurring materials with which to create your
camouflage.

Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing
yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at
least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity
(Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking
actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must
camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.

### Vanish

Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on
your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you
choose to leave a trail.

### Feral Senses

At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight
creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your
inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls
against it.

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30
feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you
aren’t blinded or deafened.

### Foe Slayer

At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once
on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack
roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your
favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the
roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.

Ranger Archetypes
-----------------

The ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the
Beast Master.

### Hunter

Emulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark
between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the
Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats
you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and
terrifying dragons.

#### Hunter’s Prey

At 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

***Colossus Slayer.*** Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes.
When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an
extra 1d8 damage if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this
extra damage only once per turn.

***Giant Killer.*** When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you
hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack
that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see
the creature.

> ***Horde Breaker.*** Once on each of your turns when

you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same
weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the
original target and within range of your weapon.

#### Defensive Tactics

At 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

> ***Escape the Horde.*** Opportunity attacks against you are made with
> disadvantage.

***Multiattack Defense.*** When a creature hits you with an attack, you
gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that
creature for the rest of the turn.

***Steel Will.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being
frightened.

#### Multiattack

At 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

***Volley.*** You can use your action to make a ranged attack against
any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within
your weapon’s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as
normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.

***Whirlwind Attack.*** You can use your action to make a melee attack
against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate
attack roll for each target.

#### Superior Hunter’s Defense

At 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.

***Evasion.*** When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red
dragon’s fiery breath or a *lightning bolt* spell, that allows you to
make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take
no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if
you fail.

> ***Stand Against the Tide.*** When a hostile creature misses you with
> a melee attack, you can use your

reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against
another creature (other than itself) of your choice.

***Uncanny Dodge.*** When an attacker that you can see hits you with an
attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against
you.

Rogue
=====

#### The Rogue

> **Expertise**

At 1st level, choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your
skill proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your
proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses
either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills
or with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.

> **Sneak Attack**

Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a
foe’s distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to
one creature you hit with an attack if you have advantage on the attack
roll. The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.

You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the
target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you
don’t have

disadvantage on the attack roll.

> **Level**

> **Proficiency**

> column of the Rogue table.

### Thieves’ Cant

> During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of
> dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in
> seemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows
> thieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer to
> convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
>
> In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to
> convey short, simple messages,

such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves’
guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy
marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.

### Cunning Action

Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move
and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in
combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or
Hide action.

### Roguish Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise
of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all
detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice
grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th
level.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th
level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you
can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you
can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Uncanny Dodge

Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with
an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage
against you.

### Evasion

Beginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain
area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an *ice storm*
spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a
Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no
damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you
fail.

### Reliable Talent

By 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach
perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your
proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

### Blindsense

Starting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the
location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.

### Slippery Mind

By 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain
proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

### Elusive

Beginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain
the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you
while you aren’t incapacitated.

### Stroke of Luck

At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need
to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss
into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat
the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.

Roguish Archetypes
------------------

Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on
perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat,
and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those
talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your
choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an
indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your
preferred techniques.

### Thief

You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits,
cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so
do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure
seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving
your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into
ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you
normally couldn’t employ.

#### Fast Hands

Starting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your
Cunning Action to make a Dexterity

(Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or
open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

#### Second-Story Work

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to
climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.

In addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover
increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.

#### Supreme Sneak

Starting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check
if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.

#### Use Magic Device

By 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that
you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for
you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of
magic items.

#### Thief’s Reflexes

When you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and
quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round
of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and
your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature
when you are surprised.

> **Spellcasting**

An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an
indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of
magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer
spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at
higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer
table.

#### Spell Slots

The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer spells,
you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all
expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-­‐‑level spell *burning hands* and have
a 1st-­‐‑level and a 2nd-­‐‑level spell slot available, you can cast
*burning hands* using either slot.

> **Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher** You know two 1st-­‐‑level
> spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn more
sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level
for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level
in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells, since
the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into
the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to

> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
> modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer
spells.

### Sorcerous Origin

Choose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate
magical power: Draconic Bloodline or Wild Magic, both detailed at the
end of the class description.

> Your choice grants you features when you choose

it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Font of Magic

At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself.
This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to
create a variety of magical effects.

#### Sorcery Points

You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels,
as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can
never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level.
You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.

#### Flexible Casting

You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or
sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other
ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.

***Creating Spell Slots.*** You can transform unexpended sorcery points
into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell
Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level.
You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a
long rest.

#### Creating Spell Slots

your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier
when setting the saving throw DC

for a sorcerer spell you cast and when making an

attack roll with one.

> 3rd 5

>
> 5th 7
>
> ***Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points.*** As a bonus action on
> your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery
> points equal to the slot’s level.

### Metamagic

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your
needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice.
You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it,
unless otherwise noted.

#### Careful Spell

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving
throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full
force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those
creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A
chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the
spell.

#### Distant Spell

When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can
spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.

When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery
point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

#### Empowered Spell

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to
reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum
of one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different
Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

#### Extended Spell

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can
spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of
24 hours.

#### Heightened Spell

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to
resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of
the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

#### Quickened Spell

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend
2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this
casting.

#### Subtle Spell

When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without
any somatic or verbal components.

#### Twinned Spell

When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a
range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the
spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the same spell
(1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

> To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of
>
> targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For
> example, *magic missile* and *scorching ray* aren’t eligible, but *ray
> of frost* and *chromatic orb* are.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Sorcerous Restoration

At 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish
a short rest.

Sorcerous Origins
-----------------

Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic.
Although many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two
categories: a draconic bloodline and wild magic.

### Draconic Bloodline

Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your
blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin
trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made
a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent.
Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are
obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a
result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.

#### Dragon Ancestor

At 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage
type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.

> **Draconic Ancestry Dragon Damage Type** Black Acid
>
> Blue Lightning
>
> Brass Fire Bronze Lightning Copper Acid
>
> Gold Fire
>
> Green Poison
>
> Red Fire
>
> Silver Cold
>
> White Cold

You can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make
a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus
is doubled if it applies to the check.

#### Draconic Resilience

As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your
dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum
increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in
this class.

Additionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of
dragon-­‐‑like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13
+ your Dexterity modifier.

#### Elemental Affinity

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the
type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma
modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can
spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

#### Dragon Wings

At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings
from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You
can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until
you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.

You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is
made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your
wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.

#### Draconic Presence

Beginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your
dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or
frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this
power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60
feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were
casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its
turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed
(if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura
ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your
aura for 24 hours.

> **Otherworldly Patron**
>
> At 1st level, you have struck a bargain with an otherworldly being of
> your choice: the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each of
> which is detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice
> grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th
> level.
>
> **Pact Magic**
>
> Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have
> given you facility with spells.

#### Cantrips

> You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You
> learn additional warlock

cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known
column of the Warlock table.

#### Spell Slots

The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also
shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the
same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher,
you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when
you finish a short or long rest.

For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-­‐‑level spell
slots. To cast the 1st-­‐‑level spell *thunderwave*, you must spend one
of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-­‐‑level spell.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

At 1st level, you know two 1st-­‐‑level spells of your choice from the
warlock spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more
warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you
choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s
Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example,
you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the
warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have
spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you
use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll
with one.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
> modifier
>
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
> modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock
spells.

### Eldritch Invocations

In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations,
fragments of forbidden

knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.

At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your
invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description.
When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of
your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock
table.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of
the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you
could learn at that level.

### Pact Boon

At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your
loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.

#### Pact of the Chain

You learn the *find familiar* spell and can cast it as a ritual. The
spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.

When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your
familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon,
quasit, or sprite.

Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your
own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with
its reaction.

#### Pact of the Blade

You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You
can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create
it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as
magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to
nonmagical attacks and damage.

Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for
1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if
you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.

You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a
special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over
the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can
then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and
it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t
affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases
being your

pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-­‐‑hour ritual on a
different weapon, or if you use a 1-­‐‑hour ritual to break your bond to
it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional
space when the bond breaks.

#### Pact of the Tome

Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain
this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the
three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person,
you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your
number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell
list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.

If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-­‐‑hour ceremony
to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be
performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous
book. The book turns to ash when you die.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Mystic Arcanum

At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an
arcanum. Choose one 6th-­‐‑ level spell from the warlock spell list as
this arcanum.

You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You
must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can
be cast in this way: one 7th-­‐‑ level spell at 13th level, one
8th-­‐‑level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-­‐‑level spell at 17th
level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long
rest.

### Eldritch Master

At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power
while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can
spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your
expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell
slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do
so again.

Eldritch Invocations
--------------------

If an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn
it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its
prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.

#### Agonizing Blast

> *Prerequisite:* eldritch blast *cantrip*

When you cast *eldritch blast*, add your Charisma modifier to the damage
it deals on a hit.

#### Armor of Shadows

You can cast *mage armor* on yourself at will, without expending a spell
slot or material components.

#### Ascendant Step

> *Prerequisite: 9th level*

You can cast *levitate* on yourself at will, without expending a spell
slot or material components.

#### Beast Speech

#### Bewitching Whispers

You can cast *compulsion* once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do

#### Book of Ancient Secrets

> *Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature*

You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two
1st-­‐‑level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list
(the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book
and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of
Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t
cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some
other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if
it has the ritual tag.

On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of
Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the
spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded
up) and if you can spare the time to

transcribe the spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription
process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to
inscribe it.

#### Chains of Carceri

> *Prerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature*

You can cast *hold monster* at will—targeting a celestial, fiend, or
elemental—without expending a spell slot or material components. You

without expending a spell slot or material components.

#### Gaze of Two Minds

You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through
its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is
on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on
subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration
until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other
creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that
creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.

#### Lifedrinker

> *Prerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Blade feature*

When you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra
necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).

reaction.

up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line.

#### Sculptor of Flesh

You can cast *polymorph* once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do
so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Sign of Ill Omen

> *Prerequisite: 5th level*

You can cast *bestow curse* once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t
do so again until you finish a long rest.

#### Thief of Five Fates

> slot.

You can see the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by
illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of
you and within line of sight.

Otherworldly Patrons
--------------------

The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of
other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power.
Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and
invocations, and expect significant favors in return.

Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively
freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other
patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with
only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each
other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

### The Fiend

You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a
being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such
beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately
including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon
lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-­‐‑luu, and Baphomet;
archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit
fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other
lords of the yugoloths.

#### Expanded Spell List

The Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn
a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell
list for you.

#### Fiend Expanded Spells

> **Spell Level Spells**
>
> 1st *burning hands, command*
>
> 2nd *blindness/deafness, scorching ray*
>
> 3rd *fireball, stinking cloud*
>
> 4th *fire shield, wall of fire*
>
> 5th *flame strike, hallow*

#### Dark One’s Blessing

Starting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit
points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier +
your warlock level (minimum of 1).

#### Dark One’s Own Luck

Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your
favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use
this feature to

add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but
before any of the roll’s effects occur.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a
short or long rest.

#### Fiendish Resilience

Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a
short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you
choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or
silver weapons ignores this resistance.

#### Hurl Through Hell

Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can
use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower
planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare
landscape.

At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it
previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is
not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific
experience.

> Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again

until you finish a long rest.

##### Your Pact Boon

> Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that
> reflects your patron’s nature.
>
> ***Pact of the Chain.*** Your familiar is more cunning than a typical
> familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with
> sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits
> tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One’s nature is inscrutable,
> any familiar form is suitable for it.
>
> ***Pact of the Blade.*** If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon
> might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the
> Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned
> with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your
> weapon might be an ancient-­‐looking spear, with a gemstone embedded
> in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.
>
> ***Pact of the Tome.*** Your Book of Shadows might be a fine,
> gilt-­‐edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to
> you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon
> hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of
> forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the
> Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by
> contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only
> your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.

> **Spellcasting**
>
> As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells
> that show the first glimmerings of your true power.

#### Cantrips

> At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard
> spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at
> higher levels, as
>
> shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.

#### Spellbook

> At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-­‐‑ level wizard
> spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard
> spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells

The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a
slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots
when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to
cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook
equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one
spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you’re a 3rd-­‐‑level wizard, you have four 1st-­‐‑level
and two 2nd-­‐‑level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list
of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-­‐‑level
spell *magic missile,* you can cast it using a 1st-­‐‑level or a
2nd-­‐‑level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of
prepared spells.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest.
Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your
spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to
cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since
you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use
your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.
In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving
throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with
one.

> **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
> modifier
>
> **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
> modifier

#### Ritual Casting

You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag
and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the
spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard
spells.

**Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher** Each time you gain a wizard
level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook
for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have
spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might
find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your
Spellbook” sidebar).

### Arcane Recovery

You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your
spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose
expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined
level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up),
and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you’re a 4th-­‐‑level wizard, you can recover up to two
levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-­‐‑level spell
slot or two 1st-­‐‑level spell slots.

### Arcane Tradition

When you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your
practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration,
Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or
Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.

Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and
14th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Spell Mastery

At 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that
you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-­‐‑level wizard spell and a
2nd-­‐‑level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those
spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you
have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level,
you must expend a spell slot as normal.

By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells
you chose for different spells of the same levels.

### Signature Spells

When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and
can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-­‐‑level wizard spells
in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells
prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have
prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without
expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you
finish a short or long rest.

If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a
spell slot as normal.

Arcane Traditions
-----------------

The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal
discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds,
with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.

The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the
schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of
spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some
places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at
the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School
of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like
academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and
funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own
towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device,
since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.

### School of Evocation

You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects
such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling
lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military
forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use
their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own
gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.

#### Evocation Savant

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time
you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.

#### Sculpt Spells

Beginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within
the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell
that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number
of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures
automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they
take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful
save.

#### Potent Cantrip

Starting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that
avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving
throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage
(if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.

#### Empowered Evocation

Beginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one
damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.

#### Overchannel

Starting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler
spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals
damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.

The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this
feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic
damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each
time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the
necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12. This damage ignores
resistance and immunity.

##### Your Spellbook

> The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect
> the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual
> breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You
> might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a
> spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or
> in a dusty tome in an ancient library.
>
> ***Copying a Spell into the Book.*** When you find a wizard
>
> spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it
> is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to
> decipher and copy it.
>
> Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic
> form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used
> by the wizard who wrote it. You
>
> must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures
> required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own
> notation.
>
> For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and
>
> costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you
> experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you
> need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can
> prepare the spell just like your other spells.
>
> ***Replacing the Book.*** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook
> into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of
> your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your
> spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own
> notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1
> hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.
>
> If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same
>
> procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new
> spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to
> find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards
> keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.
>
> ***The Book’s Appearance.*** Your spellbook is a unique compilation of
> spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might
> be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from
> your master, a finely bound gilt-­‐edged tome you found in an ancient
> library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after
> you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.

Beyond 1st Level
================

> As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or
> she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character
> who reaches a specified experience point total advances in capability.
> This advancement is called **gaining a level**.
>
> When your character gains a level, his or her class
>
> often grants additional features, as detailed in the class
> description. Some of these features allow you to increase your ability
> scores, either increasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score
> by 2. You can’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every
> character’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.
>
> Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that
> Hit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total
> to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value
> shown in your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll
> (rounded up).
>
> When your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum
> increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For example, if your
> 7th-­‐‑level fighter has a Constitution score of 18, when he reaches
> 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus
> increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point
> maximum then increases by 8.
>
> The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance
> in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for
> a character of that level. Consult the information in your character’s
> class description to see what other improvements you gain at each
> level.

#### Character Advancement

  > 195,000   > 16   > +5

  > 225,000   > 17   > +6
  > 265,000   > 18   > +6
  > 305,000   > 19   > +6
  > 355,000   > 20   > +6

> **Multiclassing**
>
> Multiclassing allows you to gain levels in multiple classes. Doing so
> lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a character
> concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard class
> options.
>
> With this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new class
> whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in your
> current class. Your levels in all your classes are added together to
> determine your character level. For example, if you have three levels
> in wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th-­‐‑level character.
>
> As you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of your
> original class with just a few levels in another class, or you might
> change course entirely, never looking back at the class you left
> behind. You might even start progressing in a third or fourth class.
> Compared to a single-­‐‑class character of the same level, you’ll
> sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.

### Prerequisites

> To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score
> prerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown
> in the Multiclassing Prerequisites table. For example, a barbarian who
> decides to multiclass into the druid class must have both Strength and
> Wisdom scores of 13 or higher. Without the full training that a
> beginning character receives, you must be a quick study in your new
> class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected by higher-­‐‑
> than-­‐‑average ability scores.

#### Multiclassing Prerequisites

> **Class Ability Score Minimum**
>
> Barbarian Strength 13
>
> Bard Charisma 13
>
> Cleric Wisdom 13
>
> Druid Wisdom 13
>
> Fighter Strength 13 or Dexterity 13
>
> Monk Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13
>
> Paladin Strength 13 and Charisma 13
>
> Ranger Dexterity 13 and Wisdom 13
>
> Rogue Dexterity 13
>
> Sorcerer Charisma 13
>
> Warlock Charisma 13
>
> Wizard Intelligence 13

### Experience Points

The experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your total
character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table, not your
level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric 6/fighter 1, you
must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you can take your second
level as a fighter or your seventh level as a cleric.

### Hit Points and Hit Dice

You gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels
after 1st. You gain the 1st-­‐‑level hit points for a class only when
you are a 1st-­‐‑level character.

You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your
pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply
pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a
d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If
your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them
separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five
d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.

### Proficiency Bonus

Your proficiency bonus is always based on your total character level, as
shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not your level in
a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter 3/rogue 2, you
have the proficiency bonus of a 5th-­‐‑ level character, which is +3.

### Proficiencies

When you gain your first level in a class other than your initial class,
you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as shown in
the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.

#### Multiclassing Proficiencies

> **Class Proficiencies Gained**
>
> Barbarian Shields, simple weapons, martial weapons Bard Light armor,
> one skill of your choice, one musical
>
> instrument of your choice
>
> Cleric Light armor, medium armor, shields
>
> Druid Light armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor
> or use shields made of metal)
>
> Fighter Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial
> weapons
>
> Monk Simple weapons, shortswords
>
> Paladin Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial
> weapons
>
> Ranger Light armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial
> weapons, one skill from the class’s skill list
>
> Rogue Light armor, one skill from the class’s skill list, thieves’
> tools
>
> Sorcerer —
>
> Warlock Light armor, simple weapons Wizard —

### Class Features

When you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that
level. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment, and a
few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing: Channel
Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.

#### Channel Divinity

If you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in a
class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity
effects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t
give you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when you
reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if
you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between
rests because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more
uses. Whenever you use the feature, you can choose any of the Channel
Divinity effects available to you from your two classes.

#### Extra Attack

If you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class, the
features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two attacks with
this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s version of Extra
Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch invocation Thirsting
Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if you also have Extra Attack.

#### Unarmored Defense

If you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it
again from another class.

#### Spellcasting

Your capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined levels in
all your spellcasting classes and partly on your individual levels in
those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting feature from more than one
class, use the rules below. If you multiclass

but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class, you follow the
rules as described in that class.

***Spells Known and Prepared.*** You determine what spells you know and
can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a
single-­‐‑classed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3,
for example, you know three 1st-­‐‑level ranger spells based on your
levels in the ranger class. As 3rd-­‐‑level wizard, you know three
wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of
which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be
2nd-­‐‑level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six
wizard spells from your spellbook.

Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes,
and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you cast the
spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy symbol, can be
used only for the spells from the class associated with that focus.

***Spell Slots.*** You determine your available spell slots by adding
together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, and
wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in the paladin and
ranger classes. Use this total to determine your spell slots by
consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.

If you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give you
spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know or can
prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower-­‐‑level
spells. If a lower-­‐‑level spell that you cast, like *burning hands*,
has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-­‐‑level slot, you can
use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any spells of that
higher level.

For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count
as a 5th-­‐‑level character when determining your spell slots: you have
four 1st-­‐‑level slots, three 2nd-­‐‑level slots, and two 3rd-­‐‑level
slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd-­‐‑level spells, nor do you know
any 2nd-­‐‑level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those
levels to cast the spells you do know—and potentially enhance their
effects.

> ***Pact Magic.*** If you have both the Spellcasting class

feature and the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can
use the spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells
you know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class
feature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the Spellcasting
class feature to cast warlock spells you know.

### Alignment

A typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly
describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination
of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and
the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic,
or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible
combinations.

These brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical
behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary
significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly
and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.

> **Lawful good** (LG) creatures can be counted on to

do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and
most dwarves are lawful good.

**Neutral good** (NG) folk do the best they can to

help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud
giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.

> **Chaotic good** (CG) creatures act as their

conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper
dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.

**Lawful neutral** (LN) individuals act in accordance with law,
tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful
neutral.

> **Neutral** (N) is the alignment of those who prefer

to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems
best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.

> **Chaotic neutral** (CN) creatures follow their

whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians
and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.

> **Lawful evil** (LE) creatures methodically take what

they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order.
Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.

> **Neutral evil** (NE) is the alignment of those who

do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many
drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.

> **Chaotic evil** (CE) creatures act with arbitrary

violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red
dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.

#### Alignment in the Multiverse

For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans,
dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow
the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-­‐‑
aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their
moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.

The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to
serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the
nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the
orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a
good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its
entire life. (Even half-­‐‑orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s
influence.)

> Alignment is an essential part of the nature of

celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it
doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its
essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a
devil.

> Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational

thought do not have alignments—they are **unaligned**. Such a creature
is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to
its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they
are not evil; they have no alignment.

### Languages

Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default,
and your background might give you access to one or more additional
languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.

Choose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one
that is common in your campaign. With your GM’s permission, you can
instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret
language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.

Some of these languages are actually families of languages with many
dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran,
Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental
planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can
communicate with one another.

#### Standard Languages

  > **Language**   > **Typical Speakers**   > **Script**

  > Undercommon    > Underworld traders     > Elvish

> **Inspiration**

Inspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing
your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits,
ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your
personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge
in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call
on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect
of a spell that has been laid on you.

### Gaining Inspiration

Your GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons.
Typically, GMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give
in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray
your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can
earn inspiration in the game.

> You either have inspiration or you don’t—you

can’t stockpile multiple “inspirations” for later use.

### Using Inspiration

If you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll,
saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you
advantage on that roll.

Additionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for
good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in
the game. When another player character does something that really
contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up
your inspiration to give that character inspiration.

Backgrounds
-----------

Every story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals where
you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the
world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled
soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue
might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a
jester.

> Choosing a background provides you with

important story cues about your character’s identity. The most important
question to ask about your background is *what changed*? Why did you
stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring?
Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you
come from a wealthy background, why don’t you have *more* money? How did
you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary
people who share your background?

The sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete benefits
(features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying suggestions.

#### Proficiencies

Each background gives a character proficiency in two skills (described
in “Using Ability Scores”).

In addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or
more tools (detailed in “Equipment”).

If a character would gain the same proficiency from two different
sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same kind
(skill or tool) instead.

#### Languages

Some backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages
beyond those given by race. See “Languages.”

#### Equipment

Each background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use the
optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the starting
equipment from your background.

#### Suggested Characteristics

A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your
background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them
randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of
your own creation.

#### Customizing a Background

You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it
better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a
background, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any
two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or languages
from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the equipment package
from your background or spend coin on gear as described in the equipment
section. (If you spend coin, you can’t also take the equipment package
suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one
ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can’t find a feature that matches
your desired background, work with your GM to create one.

> **Acolyte**

You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or
pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the
holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering
sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the
divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing sacred rites is not
the same thing as channeling divine power.

Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-­‐‑divine being
from among those listed in "Fantasy-­‐‑Historical Pantheons" or those
specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of your
religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised
from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a
high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a
different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of
any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a
fiendish master that you now deny.

> **Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Religion
>
> **Languages:** Two of your choice
>
> **Equipment:** A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered the
> priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of incense,
> vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch containing 15 gp

#### Feature: Shelter of the Faithful

As an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your faith,
and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity. You and your
adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and care at a
temple, shrine, or other established presence of your faith, though you
must provide any material components needed for spells. Those who share
your religion will support you (but only you) at a modest lifestyle.

You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen
deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the
temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms with it, or
a temple where you have found a new home. While near your temple, you
can call upon the priests for assistance, provided the assistance you
ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good standing with your
temple.

#### Suggested Characteristics

Acolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other religious
communities. Their study of the history and tenets of their faith and
their relationships to temples, shrines, or hierarchies affect their
mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or
heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.

Using Ability Scores
====================

Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature’s physical
and mental characteristics:

-   **Strength**, measuring physical power

-   **Dexterity**, measuring agility

-   **Constitution**, measuring endurance

-   **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory

-   **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight

-   **Charisma**, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-­‐‑bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming?
Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities—a creature’s
assets as well as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the game—the ability check, the saving throw,
and the attack roll—rely on the six ability scores. The book’s
introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20,
add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and
compare the total to a target number.

**Ability Scores and Modifiers** Each of a creature’s abilities has a
score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability
score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses
a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that
ability.

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and
many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18
is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have
scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as
high as 30.

Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging
from −5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The
Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the
range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.

#### Ability Scores and Modifiers

> **Score Modifier**
>
> 1 −5
>
> 2–3 −4
>
> 4–5 −3
>
> 6–7 −2
>
> 8–9 −1
>
> 10–11 +0
>
> 12–13 +1
>
> 14–15 +2
>
> 16–17 +3
>
> 18–19 +4
>
> 20–21 +5
>
> 22–23 +6
>
> 24–25 +7
>
> 26–27 +8
>
> 28–29 +9
>
> 30 +10

To determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract
10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).

Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability
check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often
than their associated scores.

> **Advantage and Disadvantage**

Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage
or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll.
When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the
higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if
you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a
17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those
numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or
imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20.
If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll
only one additional d20.

> If circumstances cause a roll to have both

advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them,
and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose
disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a
situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.

When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such
as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll
only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling
has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a
13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.

You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special
abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character
advantage. The

GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction
or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.

Proficiency Bonus
-----------------

Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also
have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus
is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.

Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other
number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can
add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless
add the bonus only once when you make the save.

Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided
(doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the
rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain
ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus
applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and
multiply or divide it only once.

By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your
proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally
benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to
the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact
that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack
proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature
that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence
(History) checks.

In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls
or saving throws. If a feature or effect allows you to do so, these same
rules apply.

Ability Checks
--------------

An ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and
training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an
ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than
an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain,
the dice determine the results.

For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is
relevant to the task at hand and the

#### Typical Difficulty Classes

> **Task Difficulty DC**
>
> Very easy 5
>
> Easy 10
>
> Medium 15
>
> Hard 20
>
> Very hard 25
>
> Nearly impossible 30

To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability
modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and
compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the
ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand.
Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no
progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback
determined by the GM.

> **Contests**

Sometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed to
another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same
thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic
ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one
of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—
for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an
adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is
determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.

Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their
efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead
of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two
checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest.
That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the
other one from succeeding.

If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it
was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by
default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the
floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying
to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie
means that the door remains shut.

### Skills

difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class.

The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty
Classes table shows the most common DCs.

Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that
a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a
specific aspect of an

ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a
focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are
determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies
appear in the monster’s stat block.)

For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to
pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each
of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics,
Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has
proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity
checks related to sneaking and hiding.

The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following
list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s
description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to
use a skill associated with an ability.

#### Strength

-   Athletics

#### Dexterity

-   Acrobatics

-   Sleight of Hand

-   Stealth

#### Intelligence

-   Arcana

-   History

-   Investigation

-   Nature

-   Religion

#### Wisdom

-   Animal Handling

-   Insight

-   Medicine

-   Perception

-   Survival

#### Charisma

-   Deception

-   Intimidation

-   Performance

-   Persuasion

Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific
skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a
player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to
a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means

an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks
that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the
individual makes a normal ability check.

> For example, if a character attempts to climb up a

dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If
the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency
bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that
proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.

**Variant: Skills with Different Abilities** Normally, your proficiency
in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency
in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some
situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a
different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check
using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your
GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if
you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might
call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it
that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your
proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check.
So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus
to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength
(Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-­‐‑orc barbarian uses a
display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a
Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally
associated with Charisma.

### Passive Checks

A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve
any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task
done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again,
or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the
characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a
hidden monster.

Here’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:

> 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check

If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage,
subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a **score**.

For example, if a 1st-­‐‑level character has a Wisdom of 15 and
proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception)
score of 14.

The rules on hiding in the “Dexterity” section below rely on passive
checks, as do the exploration rules.

### Working Together

Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The
character who’s leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability
modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help
provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help
action.

A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she
could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires
proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that
proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a
character can help only when two or more individuals working together
would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle,
are no easier with help.

#### Group Checks

When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a
group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation,
the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who
aren’t.

To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability
check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds.
Otherwise, the group fails.

Group checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all
the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers
are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival)
check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and
other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group
succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions
out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.

Using Each Ability
------------------

Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is
covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more
detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.

### Strength

Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to
which you can exert raw physical force.

#### Strength Checks

A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break
something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply
brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in
certain kinds of Strength checks.

> ***Athletics.*** Your Strength (Athletics) check covers

difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming.
Examples include the following activities:

-   You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while
    > scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to
    > knock you off.

-   You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a
    > stunt midjump.

-   You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents,
    > storm-­‐‑tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another
    > creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise
    > interfere with your swimming.

***Other Strength Checks.*** The GM might also call for a Strength check
when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door

-   Break free of bonds

-   Push through a tunnel that is too small

-   Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it

-   Tip over a statue

-   Keep a boulder from rolling

#### Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll
when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a
javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-­‐‑
to-­‐‑hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged
attack.

#### Lifting and Carrying

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The
following terms define what you can lift or carry.

***Carrying Capacity.*** Your carrying capacity is your Strength score
multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry,
which is high enough

that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.

***Push, Drag, or Lift.*** You can push, drag, or lift a weight in
pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength
score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying
capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

***Size and Strength.*** Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas
Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium,
double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push,
drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.

#### Variant: Encumbrance

The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a
variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a
character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this
variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.

If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are
**encumbered**, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.

If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to
your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead **heavily encumbered**,
which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on
ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength,
Dexterity, or Constitution.

### Dexterity

Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.

#### Dexterity Checks

A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or
quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics,
Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of
Dexterity checks.

> ***Acrobatics.*** Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check

covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as
when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope,
or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The GM might also call for a
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts,
including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.

***Sleight of Hand.*** Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or
manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or
concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)

check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to
determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip
something out of another person’s pocket.

> ***Stealth.*** Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when

you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip
away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or
heard.

> ***Other Dexterity Checks.*** The GM might call for a Dexterity check
> when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent

-   Steer a chariot around a tight turn

-   Pick a lock

-   Disable a trap

-   Securely tie up a prisoner

-   Wriggle free of bonds

-   Play a stringed instrument

-   Craft a small or detailed object

#### Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll
when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You
can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage
roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property,
such as a dagger or a rapier.

#### Armor Class

Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your
Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.

#### Initiative

At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a
Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in
combat.

##### Hiding

> The DM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you
> try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are
> discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the
> Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for
> signs of your presence.
>
> You can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give
> away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or
> knocking over a vase.
>
> An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage
> might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.
>
> In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around,
> so if you come out of hiding and approach a
>
> creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances,
> the DM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that
> is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before
> you are seen.
>
> ***Passive Perception.*** When you hide, there’s a chance someone will
> notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a
> creature notices you, the DM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check
> with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals
> 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or
> penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage,
> subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-­‐level character (with a
> proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and
> proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception)
> of 14.
>
> ***What Can You See?*** One of the main factors in determining whether
> you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an
> area, which might be **lightly** or **heavily obscured**, as explained
> in chapter 8, “Adventuring.”

### Constitution

Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.

#### Constitution Checks

Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution
checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive
rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or
monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond
normal limits, however.

The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish
tasks like the following:

-   Hold your breath

-   March or labor for hours without rest

-   Go without sleep

-   Survive without food or water

-   Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go

#### Hit Points

Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically,
you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit
points.

If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as
well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if
you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your
Constitution modifier increases from

+1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had
always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and
then roll

your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th
level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce
your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.

### Intelligence

Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability
to reason.

#### Intelligence Checks

An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic,
education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History,
Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain
kinds of Intelligence checks.

***Arcana.*** Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to
recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical
traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those
planes.

***History.*** Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability
to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient
kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.

> ***Investigation.*** When you look around for clues

and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence
(Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object,
discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or
determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse.
Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of
knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.

***Nature.*** Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to
recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural
cycles.

> ***Religion.*** Your Intelligence (Religion) check

measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers,
religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.

> ***Other Intelligence Checks.*** The GM might call for an Intelligence
> check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Communicate with a creature without using words

-   Estimate the value of a precious item

-   Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard

-   Forge a document

-   Recall lore about a craft or trade

-   Win a game of skill

#### Spellcasting Ability

Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps
determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.

### Wisdom

Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and
represents perceptiveness and intuition.

#### Wisdom Checks

A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand
someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an
injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and
Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.

> ***Animal Handling.*** When there is any question

whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from
getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the GM might call for
a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal
Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.

> ***Insight.*** Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides

whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as
when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so
involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes
in mannerisms.

> ***Medicine.*** A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try

to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.

***Perception.*** Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or
otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general
awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For
example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door,
eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in
the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to
miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in
the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.

> ***Survival.*** The GM might ask you to make a

Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your
group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live
nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural
hazards.

> ***Other Wisdom Checks.*** The GM might call for a

Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow

-   Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead

#### Spellcasting Ability

Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability,
which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.

### Charisma

Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It
includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent
a charming or commanding personality.

#### Charisma Checks

A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain
others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or
when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception,
Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in
certain kinds of Charisma checks.

***Deception.*** Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you
can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your
actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others
through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include
trying to fast-­‐‑ talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through
gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions
with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a
blatant lie.

***Intimidation.*** When you attempt to influence someone through overt
threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to
make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry
information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from
a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a
sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.

***Performance.*** Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well
you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or
some other form of entertainment.

***Persuasion.*** When you attempt to influence someone or a group of
people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to
make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when
acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or
exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include

convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating
peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

> ***Other Charisma Checks.*** The GM might call for a Charisma check
> when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip

-   Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation

#### Spellcasting Ability

Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their
spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of
spells they cast.

Saving Throws
-------------

A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a
spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don’t
normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one
because your character or monster is at risk of harm.

> To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the

appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity
modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.

A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can
be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard,
for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill
proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or
her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability
score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that
causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is
determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in
the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a
creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

Time
----

In situations where keeping track of the passage of time is important,
the GM determines the time a task requires. The GM might use a different
time scale depending on the context of the situation at hand. In a
dungeon environment, the adventurers’ movement happens on a scale of
**minutes**. It takes them about a minute to creep down a long hallway,
another minute to check for traps on the door at the end of the hall,
and a good ten minutes to search the chamber beyond for anything
interesting or valuable.

> In a city or wilderness, a scale of **hours** is often

more appropriate. Adventurers eager to reach the lonely tower at the
heart of the forest hurry across those fifteen miles in just under four
hours’ time.

> For long journeys, a scale of **days** works best.

Following the road from Baldur’s Gate to Waterdeep, the adventurers
spend four uneventful days before a goblin ambush interrupts their
journey.

In combat and other fast-­‐‑paced situations, the game relies on
**rounds**, a 6-­‐‑second span of time.

Movement
--------

Swimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor,
scaling a treacherous mountain slope—all sorts of movement play a key
role in fantasy gaming adventures.

The GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating exact
distances or travel times: “You travel through the forest and find the
dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third day.” Even in a
dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave network, the GM can
summarize movement between encounters: “After killing the guardian at
the entrance to the ancient dwarven stronghold, you consult your map,
which leads you through miles of echoing corridors to a chasm bridged by
a narrow stone arch.”

Sometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get from
one spot to another,

whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes.

The following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in
a minute, an hour, or a day.

#### Travel Pace

While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or
slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far
the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any
effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace
makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.

***Forced March.*** The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel
for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of
exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover
the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character
must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is
10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character
suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix A).

***Mounts and Vehicles.*** For short spans of time (up to an hour), many
animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at
a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast
pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can
cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in
densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as
normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of
the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain
benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the
crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

Certain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special
vehicles, such as a *carpet of flying*, allow you to travel more
swiftly.

#### Travel Pace

> **Pace Distance Traveled per . . .**
>
> **Minute Hour Day Effect**

The rules for determining travel time depend on two factors: the speed
and travel pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving
over.

> **Speed**

Every character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in feet
that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number assumes
short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a life-­‐‑
threatening situation.

> —

> Able to use stealth

#### Difficult Terrain

The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively
simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But
adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-­‐‑filled
ruins, steep mountains, and ice-­‐‑covered ground—all considered
difficult terrain.

You move at half speed in difficult terrain— moving 1 foot in difficult
terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal
distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.

### Special Types of Movement

Movement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often involves
more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb, crawl, swim,
or jump to get where they need to go.

#### Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling

While climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2
extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or
swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface
or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics)
check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a
successful Strength (Athletics) check.

#### Jumping

Your Strength determines how far you can jump.

***Long Jump.*** When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet
up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot
immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can
leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the
jump costs a foot of movement.

This rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a
jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on
a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller
than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall.
Otherwise, you hit it.

When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land
prone.

***High Jump.*** When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a
number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least
10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing
high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot
you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances,

your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump
higher than you normally can.

You can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the
jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of
the jump plus 1½ times your height.

The Environment
---------------

By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark,
dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this
section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers
interact with the environment in such places.

### Falling

A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an
adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning
damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature
lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

### Suffocating

A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its
Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

> When a creature runs out of breath or is choking,

it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier
(minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit
points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized
until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath
for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air
before it drops to 0 hit points.

### Vision and Light

The most fundamental tasks of adventuring— noticing danger, finding
hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to
name just a few—rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness
and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.

A given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a **lightly
obscured** area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage,
creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
sight.

> A **heavily obscured** area—such as darkness,

opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature
effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A) when
trying to see something in that area.

The presence or absence of light in an environment creates three
categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.

> **Bright light** lets most creatures see normally.

Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches,

lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific
radius.

> **Dim light**, also called shadows, creates a lightly

obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a
source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The
soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly
brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.

> **Darkness** creates a heavily obscured area.

Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights),
within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in
an area of magical darkness.

#### Blindsight

A creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying
on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as
oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as
bats and true dragons, have this sense.

#### Darkvision

Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell
underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with
darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so
areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is
concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only
shades of gray.

#### Truesight

A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal
and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically
detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and
perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is
transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the
Ethereal Plane.

### Food and Water

Characters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see
appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be removed
until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.

#### Food

A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last
longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a
day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or
her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond
that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

#### Water

A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if
the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of
exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less
water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the
day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the
character takes two levels in either case.

### Interacting with Objects

A character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple
to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her
character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM
describes what, if anything, happens.

For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in
turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a
secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position,
though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM
might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench
the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the
difficulty of the task.

Characters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells.
Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can
be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The
GM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide
that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of
attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects
always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to
effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points,
it breaks.

A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM
sets the DC for any such check.

Resting
-------

Heroic though they might be, adventurers can’t spend every hour of the
day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They
need rest—time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds
and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further
adventure.

Adventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and
a long rest to end the day.

### Short Rest

A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which
a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading,
and tending to wounds.

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest,
up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the
character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls
the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The
character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide
to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some
spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.

### Long Rest

A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long,
during which a character sleeps or performs light activity: reading,
talking, eating, or standing watch for no more than 2 hours. If the rest
is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity—at least 1 hour of
walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity—the
characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.

At the end of a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The
character also regains spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to
half of the character’s total number of them (minimum of one die). For
example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four
spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest.

A character can’t benefit from more than one long rest in a 24-­‐‑hour
period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point at the start of
the rest to gain its benefits.

**Between Adventures** Between trips to dungeons and battles against
ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest,

recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also
use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor,
performing research, or spending their hard-­‐‑earned gold.

> In some cases, the passage of time is something

that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new
adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has
passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character
has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just
how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in
motion.

### Lifestyle Expenses

Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the
cost of maintaining that lifestyle.

Living a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your
character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and
groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic
lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the
city than if you live in poverty.

### Downtime Activities

Between adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing
during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration,
but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete
before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be
spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not
need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days
to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time,
or switch to a new downtime activity.

Downtime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If
you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an
activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.

#### Crafting

You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and
works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object
you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also
need access to special materials or locations

necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s
tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.

For every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more
items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend
raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want
to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every
day in 5-­‐‑ gp increments until you reach the market value of the item.
For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300
days to craft by yourself.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a
single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the
requisite tools and are working together in the same place. Each
character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping
to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool
proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in
100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.

While crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to
pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.

#### Practicing a Profession

You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest
lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long
you continue to practice your profession.

If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful
employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to
support a comfortable lifestyle instead.

If you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your
performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to
support a wealthy lifestyle instead.

#### Recuperating

You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating
injury, disease, or poison.

After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of
the following results:

-   End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.

-   For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one
    > disease or poison currently affecting you.

#### Researching

The time between adventures is a great chance to perform research,
gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the
campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling
scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and
gossip from their lips.

When you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information
is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and
whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to
seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also
require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence
(Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you
seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone’s aid. Once
those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.

For each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses.
This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.

#### Training

You can spend time between adventures learning a new language or
training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training
options.

First, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM
determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are
required.

The training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend
the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or
gain proficiency with the new tool.

The Order of Combat
-------------------

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of
weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game
organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A
**round** represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round,
each participant in a battle takes a **turn**. The order of turns is
determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls
initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the
next round if neither side has defeated the other.

##### Combat Step by Step

1.  **Determine surprise.** The GM determines whether anyone involved in
    > the combat encounter is surprised.

2.  **Establish positions.** The GM decides where all the characters and
    > monsters are located. Given the

> adventurers’ marching order or their stated positions in
>
> the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries
> are̶how far away and in what direction.

1.  **Roll initiative.** Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls
    > initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.

2.  **Take turns.** Each participant in the battle takes a turn in
    > initiative order.

3.  **Begin the next round.** When everyone involved in the combat has
    > had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the
    > fighting stops.

> **Surprise**

A band of adventurers sneaks up on a bandit camp, springing from the
trees to attack them. A gelatinous cube glides down a dungeon passage,
unnoticed by the adventurers until the cube engulfs one of them. In
these situations, one side of the battle gains surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be
stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM
compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the
passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side.
Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at
the start of the encounter.

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn
of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A
member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.

### Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat
starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their
place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group
of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same
time.

The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest
Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order
(called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The
initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-­‐‑controlled
creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters.
The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player
character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters
each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.

### Your Turn

On your turn, you can **move** a distance up to your speed and **take
one action**. You decide whether to move first or take your action
first. Your speed— sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your
character sheet.

The most common actions you can take are described in the “Actions in
Combat” section later in this chapter. Many class features and other
abilities provide additional options for your action.

The “Movement and Position” section later in this chapter gives the
rules for your move.

> You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing

anything at all on your turn. If you can’t decide what to do on your
turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in
“Actions in Combat.”

#### Bonus Actions

Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an
additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The Cunning Action
feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can
take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature
of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You
otherwise don’t have a bonus action to take.

You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose
which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.

You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the
bonus action’s timing is

specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take
actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.

#### Other Activity on Your Turn

Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your
action nor your move.

> You can communicate however you are able,

through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for
free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could
open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could
draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.

If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your
action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an
action to use, as stated in their descriptions.

> The GM might require you to use an action for any

of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an
unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to
use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a
drawbridge.

### Reactions

Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a
special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a
trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s.
The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most
common type of reaction.

When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of
your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that
creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.

Movement and Position
---------------------

In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using
movement and position to gain the upper hand.

On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as
much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the
rules here.

Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These
different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can
constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the
distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up
or until you are done moving.

### Breaking Up Your Move

You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed
before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30
feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.

#### Moving between Attacks

If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can
break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For
example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack
feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an
attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.

#### Using Different Speeds

If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying
speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your
move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved
from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move.
If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the
current move.

For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because
a wizard cast the *fly* spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk
10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.

### Difficult Terrain

Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains.
Boulder-­‐‑strewn caverns, briar-­‐‑ choked forests, treacherous
staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This
rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult
terrain.

Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs
are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature,
whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.

### Being Prone

Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because
they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the
game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.

> You can **drop prone** without using any of your

speed. **Standing up** takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of
movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30
feet, you must spend

15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have
enough movement left or if your speed is 0.

> To move while prone, you must **crawl** or use

magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs
1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3
feet of movement.

##### Interacting with Objects Around You

> Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem
> with your movement and action:

-   draw or sheathe a sword

-   open or close a door

-   withdraw a potion from your backpack

-   pick up a dropped axe

-   take a bauble from a table

-   remove a ring from your finger

-   stuff some food into your mouth

-   plant a banner in the ground

-   fish a few coins from your belt pouch

-   drink all the ale in a flagon

-   throw a lever or a switch

-   pull a torch from a sconce

-   take a book from a shelf you can reach

-   extinguish a small flame

-   don a mask

-   pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head

-   put your ear to a door

-   kick a small stone

-   turn a key in a lock

-   tap the floor with a 10-­‐foot pole

-   hand an item to another character

### Moving Around Other Creatures

You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can
move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least
two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s
space is difficult terrain for you.

Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your
move in its space.

If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an
opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.

### Flying Movement

Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also
deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone,
has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to
move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to

hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the *fly* spell.

### Creature Size

Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories
table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in
combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.

#### Size Categories

> **Size Space**
>
> Tiny 2½ by 2½ ft.
>
> Small 5 by 5 ft.
>
> Medium 5 by 5 ft.
>
> Large 10 by 10 ft.
>
> Huge 15 by 15 ft. Gargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger

#### Space

A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in
combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium
creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space
that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-­‐‑ foot-­‐‑wide doorway,
other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.

> A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to

fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of
creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium
combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-­‐‑foot radius around another
one.

Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround
a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller
one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty
Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.

#### Squeezing into a Smaller Space

A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a
creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze
through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a
space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there,
and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws.
Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the
smaller space.

Actions in Combat
-----------------

When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions
presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special
feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action
options of their own in their stat blocks.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM
tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need
to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

### Attack

The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether
you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with
your fists.

With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the “Making
an Attack” section for the rules that govern attacks.

Certain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow
you to make more than one attack with this action.

### Cast a Spell

Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have
access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell
has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an
action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a
spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a
casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action
in combat to cast such a spell.

### Dash

When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current
turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With
a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn
if you dash.

Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement
by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for
instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.

### Disengage

If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke
opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

### Dodge

When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks.
Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has
disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving
throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated
(as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.

### Help

You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task.
When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on
the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping
with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next
turn.

Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature
within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other
way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally
attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made
with advantage.

### Hide

When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in
an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you
gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and
Targets” section later in this chapter.

### Ready

Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular
circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on
your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of
your next turn.

First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your
reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that
trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it.
Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the
lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.”

When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after
the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take
only one reaction per round.

When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which
you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a
spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and

holding onto the spell’s magic requires concentration. If your
concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For
example, if you are concentrating on the *web* spell and ready *magic
missile*, your *web* spell ends, and if you take damage before you
release *magic missile* with your reaction, your concentration might be
broken.

### Search

When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding
something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you
make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation)
check.

### Use an Object

You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as
when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your
action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is
also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your
turn.

Making an Attack
----------------

Whether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range,
or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple
structure.

1.  **Choose a target.** Pick a target within your attack’s range: a
    > creature, an object, or a location.

2.  **Determine modifiers.** The GM determines

> whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or
> disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special
> abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your
> attack roll.

1.  **Resolve the attack.** You make the attack roll. On a

> hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that
> specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to
> or instead of damage.

If there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an
attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re
making an attack.

### Attack Rolls

When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack
hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the
appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or
exceeds the target’s Armor Class

(AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character
creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.

#### Modifiers to the Roll

When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to
the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus.
When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is
provided in its stat block.

***Ability Modifier.*** The ability modifier used for a melee weapon
attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon
attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property
break this rule.

Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a
spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.

***Proficiency Bonus.*** You add your proficiency bonus to your attack
roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as
well as when you attack with a spell.

#### Rolling 1 or 20

Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit
and the veteran to miss.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any
modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a critical hit, which is
explained later in this chapter.

If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of
any modifiers or the target’s AC.

### Unseen Attackers and Targets

Combatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by hiding, casting the
invisibility spell, or lurking in darkness.

When you attack a target that you can’t see, you have disadvantage on
the attack roll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s
location or you’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the
target isn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but
the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you
guessed the target’s location correctly.

When a creature can’t see you, you have advantage on attack rolls
against it. If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an
attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.

### Ranged Attacks

When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a
handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A
monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve
making a ranged attack.

#### Range

You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified
range.

If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range,
you can’t attack a target beyond this range.

Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow,
have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger
number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your
target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the
long range.

#### Ranged Attacks in Close Combat

Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When
you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means,
you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a
hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.

### Melee Attacks

Used in hand-­‐‑to-­‐‑hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a
foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon
such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee
attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other
body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.

> Most creatures have a 5-­‐‑foot **reach** and can thus

attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain
creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a
greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an
**unarmed strike**: a punch, kick, head-­‐‑butt, or similar forceful
blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals
bludgeoning damage equal to 1

+ your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.

#### Opportunity Attacks

In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an
enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an
opportunity attack.

You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can
see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use
your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature.
The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.

You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage
action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport
or when someone or something moves you without using your movement,
action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity
attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity
causes you to fall past an enemy.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting

When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon
that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack
with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other
hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus
attack, unless that modifier is negative.

If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon,
instead of making a melee attack with it.

#### Grappling

When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the
Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able
to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces
one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you
and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to
seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a
Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the
ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled
condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end
it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action
required).

> ***Escaping a Grapple.*** A grappled creature can use

its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength
(Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength
(Athletics) check.

***Moving a Grappled Creature.*** When you move, you can drag or carry
the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the
creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

##### Contests in Combat

> Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe.
> Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes
> the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling
> and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for
> improvising others.

#### Shoving a Creature

Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a
creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re
able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack
replaces one of them.

The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be
within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength
(Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If
you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet
away from you.

Cover
-----

Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during
combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit
from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the
opposite side of the cover.

There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources
of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees
aren’t added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature
that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-­‐‑quarters
cover, the target has three-­‐‑quarters cover.

> A target with **half cover** has a +2 bonus to AC and

Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks
at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large
piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that
creature is an enemy or a friend.

> A target with **three-­‐‑quarters cover** has a +5

bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-­‐‑quarters
cover if about three-­‐‑quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The
obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

A target with **total cover** can’t be targeted directly by an attack or
a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in
an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely
concealed by an obstacle.

Damage and Healing
------------------

Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who
explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-­‐‑placed
arrow, or a blast of flame from a *fireball* spell all have the
potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.

### Hit Points

Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability,
the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more
difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.

A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be
any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number
changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.

Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit
points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s
capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.

### Damage Rolls

Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it
deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the
damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other
factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to
deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.

> When attacking with a **weapon**, you add your

ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the
damage. A **spell** tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether
to add any modifiers.

> If a spell or other effect deals damage to **more**

**than one target** at the same time, roll the damage once for all of
them. For example, when a wizard casts *fireball* or a cleric casts
*flame strike*, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures
caught in the blast.

#### Critical Hits

When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the
attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice
twice and add them

together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play,
you can roll all the damage dice at once.

For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the
damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If
the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak
Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.

#### Damage Types

Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal
different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but
other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.

The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type
to a new effect.

***Acid.*** The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the
dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

> ***Bludgeoning.*** Blunt force attacks—hammers,

falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.

***Cold.*** The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and
the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.

***Fire.*** Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to
deal fire damage.

> ***Force.*** Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging
> form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including *magic
> missile* and *spiritual weapon*.
>
> ***Lightning.*** A *lightning bolt* spell and a blue dragon’s breath
> deal lightning damage.

***Necrotic.*** Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell
such as *chill touch*, withers matter and even the soul.

***Piercing.*** Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and
monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.

> ***Poison.*** Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a

green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.

***Psychic.*** Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast
deal psychic damage.

***Radiant.*** Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s *flame strike* spell
or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads
the spirit with power.

### Damage Resistance and

> **Vulnerability**

Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy
to hurt with certain types of damage.

> If a creature or an object has **resistance** to a

damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or
an object has **vulnerability** to a damage type, damage of that type is
doubled against it.

Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers
to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage
and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature
is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25
damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10
damage.

Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same
damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has
resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical
damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the
creature, not reduced by three-­‐‑ quarters.

### Healing

Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is
reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit
points, and magical methods such as a *cure wounds* spell or a *potion
of healing* can remove damage in an instant.

When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are
added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed
its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this
number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of
healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point
maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.

A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the
*revivify* spell has restored it to life.

### Dropping to 0 Hit Points

> ***Slashing.*** Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal

slashing damage.

> ***Thunder.*** A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the
> *thunderwave* spell, deals thunder damage.

When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall
unconscious, as explained in the following sections.

#### Instant Death

Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit
points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage
equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.

For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6
hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0
hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals
her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.

#### Falling Unconscious

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall
unconscious (see appendix A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain
any hit points.

#### Death Saving Throws

Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special
saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you
creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws,
this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate
now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of
succeeding on a saving throw.

Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you
fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third
success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die.
The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of
both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to
zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.

***Rolling 1 or 20.*** When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1
on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you
regain 1 hit point.

***Damage at 0 Hit Points.*** If you take any damage while you have 0
hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is
from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage
equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.

#### Stabilizing a Creature

The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If
healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that
it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.

You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious
creature and attempt to stabilize it,

which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

> A **stable** creature doesn’t make death saving

throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious.
The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving
throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t
healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.

#### Monsters and Death

Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather
than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.

> Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters

are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and
follow the same rules as player characters.

### Knocking a Creature Out

Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a
killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a
melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can
make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls
unconscious and is stable.

### Temporary Hit Points

Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a
creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a
buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from
injury.

> When you have temporary hit points and take

damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage
carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5
temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit
points and then take 2 damage.

> Because temporary hit points are separate from

your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A
character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary
hit points.

Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added
together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you
decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For
example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already
have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.

If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore
you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage
directed

at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.

Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration,
they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.

Mounted Combat
--------------

A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells
from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a
pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can
provide.

A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that
has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following
rules.

### Mounting and Dismounting

Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of
you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your
speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of
movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t
have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.

If an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you
must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount,
landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone
while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.

If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it
as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and
fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.

### Controlling a Mount

While you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the
mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as
dragons, act independently.

You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider.
Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have
such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match
yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only
three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can
move and act even on the turn that you mount it.

An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing
a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it
moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to

attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your
wishes.

In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re
on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.

Underwater Combat
-----------------

When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off
sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon
room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the
following rules apply.

> When making a **melee weapon attack**, a creature

that doesn’t have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic)
has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger,
javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.

> A **ranged weapon attack** automatically misses a

target beyond the weapon’s normal range. Even against a target within
normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a
crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a
spear, trident, or dart).

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance
to fire damage.

> **Spellcasting**

Magic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a
spell.

This chapter provides the rules for casting spells. Different character
classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells,
and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a
spell follows the rules here.

What Is a Spell?
----------------

A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical
energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited
expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the
invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place
in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then
releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the
span of seconds.

> Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or

protective wards. They can deal damage or undo it, impose or remove
conditions (see appendix A), drain life energy away, and restore life to
the dead.

Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the
multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might
yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or
trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented
by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.

### Spell Level

Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general
indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive)
*magic missile* at 1st level and the earth-­‐‑shaking *wish* at 9th.
Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by
rote—are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a
spellcaster must be to use that spell.

Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a
character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a
9th-­‐‑level spell.

### Known and Prepared Spells

Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell
firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item.
Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited
list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing
is true of many magic-­‐‑using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as
clerics and

wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for
different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.

In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at
any given time depends on the character’s level.

### Spell Slots

Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can
cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the
fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is
physically and mentally taxing, and higher-­‐‑ level spells are even
more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the
warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell
level a character can use at each character level. For example, the
3rd-­‐‑level wizard Umara has four 1st-­‐‑level spell slots and two
2nd-­‐‑level slots.

When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s
level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can
think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a
1st-­‐‑level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-­‐‑level
spell fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-­‐‑level spell fits only
in a 9th-­‐‑level slot. So when Umara casts *magic missile,* a
1st-­‐‑level spell, she spends one of her four 1st-­‐‑level slots and
has three remaining.

Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.

Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast
spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the
Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch
invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in
such a way.

#### Casting a Spell at a Higher Level

When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level
than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For
instance, if Umara casts *magic missile* using one of her 2nd-­‐‑level
slots, that *magic missile* is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands
to fill the slot it is put into.

Some spells, such as *magic missile* and *cure wounds*, have more
powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s
description.

##### Casting in Armor

> Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for
> spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing to
> cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically hampered
> by your armor for spellcasting.
>
> **Cantrips**

A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell
slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed
the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic
needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is
0.

### Rituals

Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast
following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as
a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast
than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual
version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.

To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that
grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have
such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his
or her list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature
specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.

Casting a Spell
---------------

When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed,
regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.

Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the
spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components,
and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.

### Casting Time

Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a
bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.

#### Bonus Action

A spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a
bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t
already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell
during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1
action.

#### Reactions

Some spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a
second to bring about and are cast in response to some event. If a spell
can be cast

as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do
so.

#### Longer Casting Times

Certain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to
cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time
longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each
turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while
you do so (see “Concentration” below). If your concentration is broken,
the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try
casting the spell again, you must start over.

### Range

The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like
*magic missile*, the target is a creature. For a spell like *fireball*,
the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.

Most spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a
creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the
*shield* spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.

Spells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also
have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s
effect must be you (see “Areas of Effect” later in the this chapter).

Once a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless
the spell’s description says otherwise.

### Components

A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in
order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires
verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t
provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the
spell.

#### Verbal (V)

Most spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves
aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular
combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the
threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an
area of silence, such as one created by the *silence* spell, can’t cast
a spell with a verbal component.

#### Somatic (S)

Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an
intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the
caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these
gestures.

#### Material (M)

Casting some spells requires particular objects, specified in
parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a **component
pouch** or a **spellcasting focus** (found in “Equipment”) in place of
the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a
component, a character must have that specific component before he or
she can cast the spell.

If a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell,
the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.

A spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material
components—or to hold a spellcasting focus—but it can be the same hand
that he or she uses to perform somatic components.

### Duration

A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration
can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years. Some spells
specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or
destroyed.

#### Instantaneous

Many spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or
alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because
its magic exists only for an instant.

#### Concentration

Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their
magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.

If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in
its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate
on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).

Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with
concentration. The following factors can break concentration:

-   **Casting another spell that requires concentration.** You lose
    > concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires

> concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.

-   **Taking damage.** Whenever you take damage while you are
    > concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving
    > throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the
    > damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage
    > from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you
    > make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.

-   **Being incapacitated or killed.** You lose concentration on a spell
    > if you are incapacitated or if you die.

The GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a
wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-­‐‑tossed ship, require
you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain
concentration on a spell.

### Targets

A typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected
by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you whether the spell
targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect
(described below).

Unless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it
was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is
obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a
creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says
otherwise.

#### A Clear Path to the Target

To target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be
behind total cover.

If you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an
obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of
origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.

#### Targeting Yourself

If a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself,
unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other
than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can
target yourself.

### Areas of Effect

> Spells such as *burning hands* and *cone of cold* cover an area,
> allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.

A spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has
one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere.
Every area of effect has a **point of origin**, a location from which
the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you
position its point of origin. Typically, a point of origin is a point in
space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an
object.

A spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin. If
no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a
location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the
spell’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must
provide total cover.

#### Cone

A cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A
cone’s width at a given point along

#### Sphere

You select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward
from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that
extends from the point.

A sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.

### Saving Throws

Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some
or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the
target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.

The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability
modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.

### Attack Rolls

its length is equal to that point’s distance from the

point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.

A cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s area of effect,
unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cube

You select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of
the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each
side.

A cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect,
unless you decide otherwise.

#### Cylinder

A cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular
radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on
the ground or at the height of the spell effect. The energy in a
cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the
perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s
effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance
equal to the height of the cylinder.

A cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of
effect.

#### Line

A line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its
length and covers an area defined by its width.

A line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect,
unless you decide otherwise.

Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine
whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus
with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your
proficiency bonus.

Most spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks. Remember
that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5
feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t
incapacitated.

##### The Schools of Magic

> Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools
> of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to
> all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same
> way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.
>
> The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their
> own, although some rules refer to the schools.
>
> **Abjuration** spells are protective in nature, though some of them
> have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful
> effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of
> existence.
>
> **Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects
>
> and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon
> creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the
> caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create
> objects or effects out of nothing.
>
> **Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of
> secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of
> hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant
> people or places.
>
> **Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing
>
> or controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies
>
> see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of
> action, or even control another creature like a puppet.
>
> **Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired
> effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel
> positive energy to heal wounds.
>
> **Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause
> people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are
> there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never
> happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can
> see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the
> mind of a creature.
>
> **Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such
> spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy
> from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back
> to life.
>
> Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as
> *animate dead* is not a good act, and only evil casters use such
> spells frequently.
>
> **Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature, object,

### Combining Magical Effects

The effects of different spells add together while the durations of
those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times
don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the
highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.

> For example, if two clerics cast *bless* on the same

target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she
doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice.

Spell Descriptions
------------------

#### Acid Arrow

> *2nd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 90 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder’s stomach)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts
in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a
hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at
the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with
acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of
its next turn.

> ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a

spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later)
increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Acid Splash

> *Conjuration cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature within range, or choose
two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A
target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 acid damage.

This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6),
11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

#### Aid

> *2nd-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)
>
> **Duration:** 8 hours

Your spell bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve. Choose up to
three creatures within range. Each target’s hit point maximum and
current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
3rd level or higher, a target’s hit points

increase by an additional 5 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Alarm

> *1st-­‐‑level abjuration (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine
>
> silver wire)
>
> **Duration:** 8 hours

You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or
an area within range that is no larger than a 20-­‐‑foot cube. Until the
spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a Tiny or larger creature
touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can
designate creatures that won’t set off the alarm. You also choose
whether the alarm is mental or audible.

A mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within 1
mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are sleeping.

An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds within
60 feet.

#### Alter Self

> *2nd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the
following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the
spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to
gain the benefits of a different one.

***Aquatic Adaptation.*** You adapt your body to an aquatic environment,
sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You can
breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking
speed.

***Change Appearance.*** You transform your appearance. You decide what
you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of
your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics,
if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of another race, though
none of your statistics change. You also can’t appear as a creature of a
different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same; if you’re
bipedal, you can’t use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance.
At any

time for the duration of the spell, you can use your action to change
your appearance in this way again.

***Natural Weapons.*** You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a
different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6
bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural
weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed strikes.
Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to the
attack and damage rolls you make using it.

#### Animal Messenger

> *2nd-­‐‑level enchantment (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a morsel of food)
>
> **Duration:** 24 hours

By means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message. Choose a
Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a blue jay, or
a bat. You specify a location, which you must have visited, and a
recipient who matches a general description, such as “a man or woman
dressed in the uniform of the town guard” or “a red-­‐‑haired dwarf
wearing a pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up to twenty-­‐‑five
words. The target beast travels for the duration of the spell toward the
specified location, covering about 50 miles per 24 hours for a flying
messenger, or 25 miles for other animals.

When the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature
that you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The messenger
speaks only to a creature matching the description you gave. If the
messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the spell ends, the
message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to where you cast this
spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd
level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48 hours for
each slot level above 2nd.

#### Animal Shapes

> *8th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 24 hours

Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing
creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into
the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or

lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform
affected creatures into new forms.

The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the
target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form
for each target. A target’s game statistics are replaced by the
statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment
and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the
hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it
returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it
reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage
carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t
reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked
unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by
the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak or cast spells.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The target can’t activate,
wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

#### Animate Dead

> *3rd-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** 10 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a
> pinch of bone dust)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse
of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target
with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The
target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a
corpse (the GM has the creature’s game statistics).

On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command
any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet
of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of
them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide
what action the creature will take and where it will move during its
next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a
particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature
only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the
creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops
obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of the creature
for

> another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again
> before the current 24-­‐‑hour period ends. This use of the spell
> reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated
> with this spell, rather than animating a new one.
>
> ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
> 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two
> additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the
> creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.

#### Animate Objects

> *5th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 120 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
>
> Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical
> objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium
> targets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects,
> Huge targets count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object
> larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under
> your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.
>
> As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with
> this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control
> multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same
> time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action
> the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or
> you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber
> or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends
> itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature
> continues to follow it until its task is complete.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks,
> Strength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is 10
> and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its
> speed is
>
> 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it can use for
> locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If
> the object is securely attached to a surface or a larger object, such
> as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a
> radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated
> object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original object form,
> and any remaining damage carries over to its original object form.
>
> If you command an object to attack, it can make a
>
> single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a
> slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by
> its size. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing
> or piercing damage based on its form.
>
> ***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of
> 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for each
> slot level above 5th.

#### Antilife Shell

> *5th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self (10-­‐‑foot radius)
> **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
>
> A shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-­‐‑ foot radius and
> moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures
> other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.
>
> The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching
> through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with
> ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.
>
> If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the
> barrier, the spell ends.

#### Antimagic Field

> *8th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self (10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere)
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
>
> A 10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you.
> This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the
> multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned
> creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the
> spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.

Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or
a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot
expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is
suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed
counts against its duration.

> ***Targeted Effects.*** Spells and other magical effects, such as
> *magic missile* and *charm person*, that target a creature or an
> object in the sphere have no effect on that target.

***Areas of Magic.*** The area of another spell or magical effect, such
as *fireball*, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an
area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is
suppressed. For example, the flames created by a *wall of fire* are
suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap
is large enough.

***Spells.*** Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or
an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in
it.

***Magic Items.*** The properties and powers of magic items are
suppressed in the sphere. For example, a

> *+1 longsword* in the sphere functions as a

nonmagical longsword.

A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used
against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere.
If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere
(for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a
target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be
suppressed as soon as it exits.

***Magical Travel.*** Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in
the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point
for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane
of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as
that created by the *rope trick* spell, temporarily closes while in the
sphere.

***Creatures and Objects.*** A creature or object summoned or created by
magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature
instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer
within the sphere.

> ***Dispel Magic.*** Spells and magical effects such as *dispel magic*
> have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by
> different *antimagic field* spells don’t nullify each other.

#### Antipathy/Sympathy

> *8th-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 hour
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for
> the *antipathy* effect or a drop of honey for the *sympathy* effect)
>
> **Duration:** 10 days

This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target
something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or
an area that is no larger than a 200-­‐‑foot cube. Then specify a kind
of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You
invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the
specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as
the aura’s effect.

***Antipathy.*** The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you
designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the
target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet
of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target
or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature
must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it
can’t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the
target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the
creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or
moves within 60 feet of it.

***Sympathy.*** The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel
an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or
able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within
60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use
its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach
of the target. When the creature has done so, it can’t willingly move
away from the target.

If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the
affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as
described below.

***Ending the Effect.*** If an affected creature ends its turn while not
within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a
Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer
affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or
attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is
allowed another

Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it
for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.

#### Arcane Eye

> *4th-­‐‑level divination*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air
for the duration.

You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal
vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in every
direction.

As an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. There
is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it can’t
enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the eye’s
movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in
diameter.

#### Arcane Hand

> *5th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an
unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the
spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements
of your own hand.

> The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points

equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell
ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand
doesn’t fill its space.

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns,
you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following
effects with it.

***Clenched Fist.*** The hand strikes one creature or object within 5
feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game
statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.

> ***Forceful Hand.*** The hand attempts to push a

creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose.

Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength
(Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you
have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target
up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting
ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet
of it.

***Grasping Hand.*** The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller
creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to
resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have
advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can
use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target
takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability
modifier.

***Interposing Hand.*** The hand interposes itself between you and a
creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The
hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half
cover against the target. The target can’t move through the hand’s space
if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand’s Strength
score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand’s Strength score,
the target can move toward you through the hand’s space, but that space
is difficult terrain for the target.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases
by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each
slot level above 5th.

#### Arcane Lock

> *2nd-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the
> spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it
becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate
when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You can also set
a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the object, suppresses
this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is impassable until it is broken
or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting *knock* on the object
suppresses *arcane lock* for 10 minutes.

While affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break or
force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.

#### Arcane Sword

> *7th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and
> pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a sword-­‐‑shaped plane of force that hovers within range. It
lasts for the duration.

When the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a target
of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the target takes
3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on
each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot you can see
and repeat this attack against the same target or a different one.

#### Arcanist’s Magic Aura

> *2nd-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a small square of silk)
>
> **Duration:** 24 hours

You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that
divination spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a
willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn by
another creature.

When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects.
The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same
creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it
each time, the illusion lasts until it is dispelled.

***False Aura.*** You change the way the target appears to spells and
magical effects, such as *detect magic*, that detect magical auras*.*
You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear
nonmagical, or change the object’s magical aura so that it appears to
belong to a specific school of magic that you choose. When you use this
effect on an object, you can make the false magic apparent to any
creature that handles the item.

***Mask.*** You change the way the target appears to spells and magical
effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s Divine Sense or
the trigger of a *symbol* spell. You choose a creature type and other
spells and magical effects treat the target as if it were a creature of
that type or of that alignment.

#### Astral Projection

> *9th-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 hour
>
> **Range:** 10 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell,
> you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately
> carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell
> consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Special

You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral
bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted
if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is
unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food
or air and doesn’t age.

Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way,
replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal
difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between
your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after
1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the
tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is
cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states
that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.

Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass
through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new
plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your
body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you
to re-­‐‑enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is
a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it
have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you
return to it.

The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to
dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its
physical body, and it awakens.

> The spell might also end early for you or one of

your companions. A successful *dispel magic* spell used against an
astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a
creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the
spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is
intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body,
ending its state of suspended animation.

If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in
their astral forms and

must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0
hit points.

#### Augury

> *2nd-­‐‑level divination (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones,
>
> or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

By casting gem-­‐‑inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate
cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from
an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific course of action
that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes. The GM chooses from
the following possible omens:

-   *Weal*, for good results

-   *Woe*, for bad results

-   *Weal and woe*, for both good and bad results

-   *Nothing*, for results that aren’t especially good or bad

The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that
might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or
the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long
rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the
first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.

#### Awaken

> *5th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 8 hours
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the
> spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a
precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The
target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or
less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the
ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it
gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so
forth, and it gains senses similar to a human’s. Your GM chooses
statistics appropriate for the awakened

plant, such as the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened
tree.

The awakened beast or plant is charmed by you for 30 days or until you
or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition
ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you,
based on how you treated it while it was charmed.

#### Bane

> *1st-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of blood)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must
make Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving
throw makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the
target must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack
roll or saving throw.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each
slot level above 1st.

#### Banishment

> *4th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (an item distasteful to the
>
> target)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to
another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving
throw or be banished.

> If the target is native to the plane of existence

you’re on, you banish the target to a harmless demiplane. While there,
the target is incapacitated. The target remains there until the spell
ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the
nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

> If the target is native to a different plane of

existence than the one you’re on, the target is banished with a faint
popping noise, returning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1
minute has passed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the
nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the
target doesn’t return.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each
slot level above 4th.

#### Barkskin

> *2nd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of oak bark)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. Until the spell ends, the target’s skin
has a rough, bark-­‐‑like appearance, and the target’s AC can’t be less
than 16, regardless of what kind of armor it is wearing.

#### Beacon of Hope

> *3rd-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell bestows hope and vitality. Choose any number of creatures
within range. For the duration, each target has advantage on Wisdom
saving throws and death saving throws, and regains the maximum number of
hit points possible from any healing.

#### Bestow Curse

> *3rd-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this
spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:

-   Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage
    > on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.

-   While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls
    > against you.

-   While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the
    > start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that
    > turn doing nothing.

-   While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra
    > 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

A *remove curse* spell ends this effect. At the GM’s option, you may
choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful
than those described above. The GM has final say on such a curse’s
effect.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th
level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you
use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you
use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If
you use a 9th level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled.
Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher grants a duration that doesn’t
require concentration.

#### Black Tentacles

> *4th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 90 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a
> giant squid)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-­‐‑foot square on ground that you
can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground
in the area into difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or
starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles
until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is
already restrained by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

> A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its

action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your
spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

#### Blade Barrier

> *6th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 90 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-­‐‑sharp blades made of
magical energy. The wall appears within range and lasts for the
duration. You can make a straight wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet
high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20
feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall

provides three-­‐‑quarters cover to creatures behind it, and its space
is difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time on a turn or
starts its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a
successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

#### Bless

> *1st-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You bless up to three creatures of your choice within range. Whenever a
target makes an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the
target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or
saving throw.

> ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a

spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional
creature for each slot level above 1st.

#### Blight

> *4th-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can
see within range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target
must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving
throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it.

If you target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree
or shrub, it doesn’t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.

> ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a

spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each
slot level above 4th.

#### Blindness/Deafness

> *2nd-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet

###### Components: V

> **Duration:** 1 minute

You can blind or deafen a foe. Choose one creature that you can see
within range to make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, the
target is either blinded or deafened (your choice) for the duration. At
the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving
throw. On a success, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each
slot level above 2nd.

#### Blink

> *3rd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 1 minute

Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the
spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of
existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the
casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of
your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal
Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see
within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is
available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space
(chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can
dismiss this spell as an action.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you
originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can’t see
anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be
affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren’t
there can’t perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the
ability to do so.

#### Blur

> *2nd-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you.
For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against
you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it doesn’t rely

on sight, as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as with
truesight.

#### Burning Hands

> *1st-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self (15-­‐‑foot cone)
> **Components:** V, S **Duration:** Instantaneous

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin
sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each
creature in a 15-­‐‑foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being
worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
above 1st.

#### Call Lightning

> *3rd-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 120 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall
with a 60-­‐‑foot radius, centered on a point you can see 100 feet
directly above you. The spell fails if you can’t see a point in the air
where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room
that can’t accommodate the cloud).

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt
of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature
within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends,
you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again,
targeting the same point or a different one.

If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the
spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a
new one. Under such conditions, the spell’s damage increases by 1d10.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level
above 3rd.

#### Calm Emotions

> *2nd-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each
humanoid in a 20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on a point you choose
within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to
fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving
throw, choose one of the following two effects.

You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or
frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes,
provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your
choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target
is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends
being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again,
unless the GM rules otherwise.

#### Chain Lightning

> *6th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 150 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a
> crystal rod; and three silver pins)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice
that you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to
as many as three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of
the first target. A target can be a creature or an object and can be
targeted by only one of the bolts.

A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8
lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
7th level or higher, one additional bolt leaps from the first target to
another target for each slot level above 6th.

#### Charm Person

> *1st-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V, S **Duration:** 1 hour

You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a
Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your
companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed
by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything
harmful to it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly
acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by
you.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each
slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other
when you target them.

#### Chill Touch

> *Necromancy cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 120 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 1 round

You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within
range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail it with
the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage,
and it can’t regain hit points until the start of your next turn. Until
then, the hand clings to the target.

If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls
against you until the end of your next turn.

> This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you

reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Circle of Death

> *6th-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 150 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (the powder of a crushed black pearl worth at
> least 500 gp)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A sphere of negative energy ripples out in a 60-­‐‑foot-­‐‑ radius
sphere from a point within range. Each creature in that area must make a
Constitution saving throw. A target takes 8d6 necrotic damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
7th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level
above 6th.

#### Clairvoyance

> *3rd-­‐‑level divination*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
>
> **Range:** 1 mile
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth at least 100 gp, either a
> jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to
you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location
that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in
a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it
can’t be attacked or otherwise interacted with.

When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the
chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your
action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from
*see invisibility* or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about
the size of your fist.

#### Clone

> *8th-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 hour
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp and at
> least 1 cubic inch of flesh of the creature that is to be cloned,
> which the spell consumes, and a vessel worth at least 2,000 gp that
> has a sealable lid and is large enough to hold a Medium creature, such
> as a huge urn, coffin, mud-­‐‑ filled cyst in the ground, or crystal
> container filled with salt water)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard
against death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full
size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone
be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures
indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.

At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its
soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing
to return.

The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same
personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original’s
equipment. The original creature’s physical remains, if they still
exist, become inert and can’t thereafter be restored to life, since the
creature’s soul is elsewhere.

#### Cloudkill

> *5th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 120 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a 20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-­‐‑green
fog centered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around
corners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses the
fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or
starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving
throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they
hold their breath or don’t need to breathe.

The fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns,
rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being heavier than
air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
above 5th.

#### Color Spray

> *1st-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self (15-­‐‑foot cone)
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is colored
> red, yellow, and blue)
>
> **Duration:** 1 round

A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll
6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can
effect. Creatures in a 15-­‐‑foot cone originating from you are affected
in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious
creatures and creatures that can’t see).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each
creature affected by this spell is blinded until the spell ends.
Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on

to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points
must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to
be affected.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above
1st.

#### Command

> *1st-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V
> **Duration:** 1 round

You speak a one-­‐‑word command to a creature you can see within range.
The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command
on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it
doesn’t understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful
to it.

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a
command other than one described here. If you do so, the GM determines
how the target behaves. If the target can’t follow your command, the
spell ends.

***Approach.*** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most
direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

> ***Drop.*** The target drops whatever it is holding and

then ends its turn.

***Flee.*** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the
fastest available means.

***Grovel.*** The target falls prone and then ends its turn.

> ***Halt.*** The target doesn’t move and takes no actions.

A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it
must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain
in the air.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each
slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other
when you target them.

#### Commune

> *5th-­‐‑level divination (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or unholy water)
>
> **Duration:** 1 minute

You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions
that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions
before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.

> Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so

you might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question pertains to
information that lies beyond the deity’s knowledge. In a case where a
one-­‐‑word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity’s
interests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long
rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the
first that you get no answer. The GM makes this roll in secret.

#### Commune with Nature

> *5th-­‐‑level divination (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding
territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land
within 3 miles of you. In caves and other natural underground settings,
the radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell doesn’t function where
nature has been replaced by construction, such as in dungeons and towns.

You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice about
any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:

-   terrain and bodies of water

-   prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples

-   powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead

-   influence from other planes of existence

-   buildings

For example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in the
area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and the
location of any nearby towns.

#### Comprehend Languages

> *1st-­‐‑level divination (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken
language that you hear. You also understand any written language that
you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are
written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This spell doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as
an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.

#### Cone of Cold

> *5th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self (60-­‐‑foot cone)
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a
60-­‐‑foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes
8d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one.

A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
above 5th.

#### Confusion

> *4th-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 90 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (three nut shells)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell assaults and twists creatures’ minds, spawning delusions and
provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius
sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start
of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

> **d10 Behavior**
>
> 1 The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To
> determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die
> face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn.
>
> 2–6 The creature doesn’t move or take actions this

turn.

> 7–8 The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a
> randomly determined creature
>
> within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the
> creature does nothing this turn.
>
> 9–10 The creature can act and move normally.

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom
saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for
each slot level above 4th.

#### Conjure Animals

> *3rd-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts and appear in
unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the
following options for what appears:

-   One beast of challenge rating 2 or lower

-   Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower

-   Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower

-   Eight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower Each beast is also
    > considered fey, and it disappears

when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll
initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own
turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action
required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend
themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

> The GM has the creatures’ statistics.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using certain
higher-­‐‑level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options
above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-­‐‑level
slot, three times as many with a 7th-­‐‑level slot, and four times as
many with a 9th-­‐‑level slot.

#### Conjure Celestial

> *7th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute **Range:** 90 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon a celestial of challenge rating 4 or lower, which appears in
an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The celestial
disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

> The celestial is friendly to you and your

companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the celestial, which
has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no
action required by you), as long as they don’t violate its alignment. If
you don’t issue any commands to the celestial, it defends itself from
hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

> The GM has the celestial’s statistics.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 9th-­‐‑level
spell slot, you summon a celestial of challenge rating 5 or lower.

#### Conjure Elemental

> *5th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** 90 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (burning incense for air, soft clay for earth,
> sulfur and phosphorus for fire, or water and sand for water)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire,
or water that fills a 10-­‐‑foot cube within range. An elemental of
challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in
an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental
emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground.
The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell
ends.

The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration.
Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any
verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you
don’t issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from
hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

If your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn’t disappear.
Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward
you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental
can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned
it.

> The GM has the elemental’s statistics.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
6th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot
level above 5th.

#### Conjure Fey

> *6th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute **Range:** 90 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon a fey creature of challenge rating 6 or lower, or a fey
spirit that takes the form of a beast of challenge rating 6 or lower. It
appears in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The fey
creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell
ends.

The fey creature is friendly to you and your companions for the
duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has its own turns. It
obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by
you), as long as they don’t violate its alignment. If you don’t issue
any commands to the fey creature, it defends itself from hostile
creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

If your concentration is broken, the fey creature doesn’t disappear.
Instead, you lose control of the fey creature, it becomes hostile toward
you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled fey
creature can’t be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you
summoned it.

> The GM has the fey creature’s statistics.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
7th level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot
level above 6th.

#### Conjure Minor Elementals

> *4th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute **Range:** 90 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon elementals that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see
within range. You choose one the following options for what appears:

-   One elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower

-   Two elementals of challenge rating 1 or lower

-   Four elementals of challenge rating 1/2 or lower

-   Eight elementals of challenge rating 1/4 or lower. An elemental
    > summoned by this spell disappears

when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll
initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own
turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them

(no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them,
they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no
actions.

> The GM has the creatures’ statistics.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using certain
higher-­‐‑level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options
above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th-­‐‑level slot
and three times as many with an 8th-­‐‑level slot.

#### Conjure Woodland Beings

> *4th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (one holly berry per creature summoned)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon fey creatures that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can
see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears:

-   One fey creature of challenge rating 2 or lower

-   Two fey creatures of challenge rating 1 or lower

-   Four fey creatures of challenge rating 1/2 or lower

-   Eight fey creatures of challenge rating 1/4 or lower

A summoned creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the
spell ends.

The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll
initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which have their own
turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action
required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend
themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

> The GM has the creatures’ statistics.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using certain
higher-­‐‑level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options
above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th-­‐‑level slot
and three times as many with an 8th-­‐‑level slot.

#### Contact Other Plane

> *5th-­‐‑level divination (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute **Range:** Self **Components:** V
> **Duration:** 1 minute

You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-­‐‑ dead sage, or
some other mysterious entity from

another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or
even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15
Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and
are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can’t take
actions, can’t understand what other creatures say, can’t read, and
speak only in gibberish. A *greater restoration* spell cast on you ends
this effect.

On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You
must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each
question with one word, such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,”
“irrelevant,” or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the answer to the
question). If a one-­‐‑word answer would be misleading, the GM might
instead offer a short phrase as an answer.

#### Contagion

> *5th-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Component:** V, S
> **Duration:** 7 days

Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a
creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with a
disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.

At the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make a Constitution
saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease’s
effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these
saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature
recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.

Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect
that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects
apply to it.

***Blinding Sickness.*** Pain grips the creature’s mind, and its eyes
turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and
Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.

***Filth Fever.*** A raging fever sweeps through the creature’s body.
The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving
throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.

> ***Flesh Rot.*** The creature’s flesh decays. The

creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all
damage.

***Mindfire.*** The creature’s mind becomes feverish. The creature has
disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and
the

creature behaves as if under the effects of the

> *confusion* spell during combat.

***Seizure.*** The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has
disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack
rolls that use Dexterity.

***Slimy Doom.*** The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The
creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving
throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned
until the end of its next turn.

#### Contingency

> *6th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and
> decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)
>
> **Duration:** 10 days

Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a
casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that
spell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting *contingency*,
expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn’t come
into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance
occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For
example, a *contingency* cast with *water breathing* might stipulate
that *water breathing* comes into effect when you are engulfed in water
or a similar liquid.

The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is
met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then
*contingency* ends.

The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally
target others. You can use only one *contingency* spell at a time. If
you cast this spell again, the effect of another *contingency* spell on
you ends. Also, *contingency* ends on you if its material component is
ever not on your person.

#### Continual Flame

> *2nd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell
> consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Until dispelled

A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an
object that you touch. The effect looks

like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A
*continual flame* can be covered or hidden but not smothered or
quenched.

#### Control Water

> *4th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 300 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area
you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from
any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on
your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

***Flood.*** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area
to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the
flooding water spills over onto dry land.

If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a
20-­‐‑foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other
and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path
are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles
struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a
different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on
the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.

***Part Water.*** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a
trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the separated
water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell
ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in
the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water
level is restored.

***Redirect Flow.*** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a
direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up
walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as
you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area, it resumes its
flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the
direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different
effect.

***Whirlpool.*** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet
square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of
the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the

base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or
object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet
toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength
(Athletics) check against your spell save DC.

When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts
its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex
until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half
damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex
can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described
above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.

The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object
takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains
in the vortex.

#### Control Weather

> *8th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
>
> **Range:** Self (5-­‐‑mile radius)
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood
> mixed in water)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration.
You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you
don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.

When you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions,
which are determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You can
change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4 × 10 minutes
for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can change
the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns
to normal.

When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on the
following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing
the wind, you can change its direction.

#### Precipitation

> **Stage Condition**

1.  Clear

2.  Light clouds

3.  Overcast or ground fog

4.  Rain, hail, or snow

5.  Torrential rain, driving hail, or blizzard

#### Temperature

> **Stage Condition**

1.  Unbearable heat

2.  Hot

3.  Warm

4.  Cool

5.  Cold

6.  Arctic cold

#### Wind

> **Stage Condition**

1.  Calm

2.  Moderate wind

3.  Strong wind

4.  Gale

5.  Storm

#### Create Food and Water

> *3rd-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground or in
containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or
five steeds for 24 hours. The food is bland but nourishing, and spoils
if uneaten after 24 hours. The water is clean and doesn’t go bad.

#### Create or Destroy Water

> *1st-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of water if creating water or a few
> grains of sand if destroying it)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You either create or destroy water.

***Create Water.*** You create up to 10 gallons of clean water within
range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a
30-­‐‑foot cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area.

***Destroy Water.*** You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an open
container within range. Alternatively, you destroy fog in a 30-­‐‑foot
cube within range.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, you create or destroy 10 additional gallons of
water, or the size of

the cube increases by 5 feet, for each slot level above 1st.

#### Create Undead

> *6th-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** 10 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (one clay pot filled with grave
>
> dirt, one clay pot filled with brackish water, and one 150 gp black
> onyx stone for each corpse)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You can cast this spell only at night. Choose up to three corpses of
Medium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul
under your control. (The GM has game statistics for these creatures.)

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command any
creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within 120 feet
of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of
them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide
what action the creature will take and where it will move during its
next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a
particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature
only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the
creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops
obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of the
creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature
before the current 24-­‐‑hour period ends. This use of the spell
reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have animated with
this spell, rather than animating new ones.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 7th-­‐‑level
spell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls. When
you cast this spell using an 8th-­‐‑level spell slot, you can animate or
reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or wights. When you cast
this spell using a 9th-­‐‑level spell slot, you can animate or reassert
control over six ghouls, three ghasts or wights, or two mummies.

#### Creation

> *5th-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny piece of matter of the same type of
> the item you plan to create)
>
> **Duration:** Special

You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a
nonliving object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope,
wood, or something similar. You can also use this spell to create
mineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created
must be no larger than a 5-­‐‑ foot cube, and the object must be of a
form and material that you have seen before.

The duration depends on the object’s material. If the object is composed
of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.

> **Material Duration**
>
> Vegetable matter 1 day
>
> Stone or crystal 12 hours
>
> Precious metals 1 hour
>
> Gems 10 minutes
>
> Adamantine or mithral 1 minute

Using any material created by this spell as another spell’s material
component causes that spell to fail.

> ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a

spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each
slot level above 5th.

#### Cure Wounds

> *1st-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your
spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or
constructs.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level
above 1st.

#### Dancing Lights

> *Evocation cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a
> glowworm)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create up to four torch-­‐‑sized lights within range, making them
appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the air for
the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing
vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever

form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-­‐‑ foot radius.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to
a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light
created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell’s
range.

#### Darkness

> *2nd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a
15-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads
around corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this
darkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.

> If the point you choose is on an object you are

holding or one that isn’t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates
from the object and moves with it. Completely covering the source of the
darkness with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the
darkness.

If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light created by a
spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is
dispelled.

#### Darkvision

> *2nd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate)
>
> **Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the dark.
For the duration, that creature has darkvision out to a range of 60
feet.

#### Daylight

> *3rd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 1 hour

A 60-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you
choose within range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for
an additional 60 feet.

If you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn’t
being worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves with
it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque object, such
as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.

If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of darkness created by
a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is
dispelled.

#### Death Ward

> *4th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from death.

The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of
taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell
ends.

> If the spell is still in effect when the target is

subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without
dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and
the spell ends.

#### Delayed Blast Fireball

> *7th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 150 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses
to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the
duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is
broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low
roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each
creature in a 20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on that point must
make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the
total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

The spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has
not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.

If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the
creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the spell

ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a successful
save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When it strikes a
creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead explodes.

> The fire damages objects in the area and ignites

flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot
level above 7th.

#### Demiplane

> *8th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** S
> **Duration:** 1 hour

You create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see
within range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to pass
through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that
appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or
stone. When the spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or
objects inside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also
disappears from the other side.

Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or have
the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a previous
casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents
of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by another creature,
you can have the shadowy door connect to its demiplane instead.

#### Detect Evil and Good

> *1st-­‐‑level divination*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial,
elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where
the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or
object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or
desecrated.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of
stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood
or dirt.

#### Detect Magic

> *1st-­‐‑level divination (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you.
If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint
aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic,
and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of
stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood
or dirt.

#### Detect Poison and Disease

> *1st-­‐‑level divination (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a yew leaf)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you can sense the presence and location of poisons,
poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you. You also
identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease in each
case.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of
stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood
or dirt.

#### Detect Thoughts

> *2nd-­‐‑level divination*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a copper piece)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When
you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends,
you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30
feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or
lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on
its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your
attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into
the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a
Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning
(if

any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind
(such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds,
the spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into
its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s
thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make an
Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds,
the spell ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the
course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part
of an interrogation.

You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures
you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during the
duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell
can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other
than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a
creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak
any language.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its
thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you
can’t see it, but it must still be within range.

#### Dimension Door

> *4th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 500 feet **Components:** V
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot
within range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place
you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by stating
distance and direction, such as “200 feet straight downward” or “upward
to the northwest at a 45-­‐‑ degree angle, 300 feet.”

> You can bring along objects as long as their weight

doesn’t exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing
creature of your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying
capacity. The creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this
spell.

> If you would arrive in a place already occupied by

an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with you each
take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.

#### Disguise Self

> *1st-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 1 hour

You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other
belongings on your person— look different until the spell ends or until
you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller
and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body
type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of
limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical
inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your
outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would
feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to
appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to
touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

> To discern that you are disguised, a creature can

use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

#### Disintegrate

> *6th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you
can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a
creation of magical force, such as the wall created by *wall of force.*

> A creature targeted by this spell must make a

Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40
force damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is
disintegrated.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying,
except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The
creature can be restored to life only by means of a *true resurrection*
or a *wish* spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical
object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger
object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑

cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level
above 6th.

#### Dispel Evil and Good

> *5th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Shimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and
creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration,
celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on
attack rolls against you.

You can end the spell early by using either of the following special
functions.

> ***Break Enchantment.*** As your action, you touch a

creature you can reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by a
celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The creature you
touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by such creatures.

***Dismissal.*** As your action, make a melee spell attack against a
celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can reach. On
a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home plane. The
creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be sent back to its
home plane (if it isn’t there already). If they aren’t on their home
plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and fey are sent to the
Feywild.

#### Dispel Magic

> *3rd-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 120 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell
of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or
higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting
ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check,
the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the
target if the spell’s

level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.

#### Divination

> *4th-­‐‑level divination (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial
>
> offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp,
> which the spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god’s
servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event,
or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The
reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.

The spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that
might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or
the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long
rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the
first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.

#### Divine Favor

> *1st-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Your prayer empowers you with divine radiance. Until the spell ends,
your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage on a hit.

#### Divine Word

> *7th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You utter a divine word, imbued with the power that shaped the world at
the dawn of creation. Choose any number of creatures you can see within
range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its
current hit points:

-   50 hit points or fewer: deafened for 1 minute

-   40 hit points or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10 minutes

-   30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour

-   20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly Regardless of its current
    > hit points, a celestial, an

elemental, a fey, or a fiend that fails its save is forced

back to its plane of origin (if it isn’t there already) and can’t return
to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a *wish* spell.

#### Dominate Beast

> *4th-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration.
If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has
advantage on the saving throw.

While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long
as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this
telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are
conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can
specify a simple and general course of action, such as “Attack that
creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch that object.” If the creature
completes the order and doesn’t receive further direction from you, it
defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target.
Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you
choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it to do. During
this time, you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this
requires you to use your own reaction as well.

Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw
against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a 5th-­‐‑level
spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you
use a 6th-­‐‑level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 1
hour. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the duration is
concentration, up to 8 hours.

#### Dominate Monster

> *8th-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range. It must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration.
If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has
advantage on the saving throw.

While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as
long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use
this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are

takes only the actions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you
don’t allow it to do. During this time, you can also cause the creature
to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as
well.

> Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new

Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the
spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a 9th-­‐‑level
spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

#### Dominate Person

> *5th-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to beguile a humanoid that you can see within range. It must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration.
If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has
advantage on the saving throw.

While the target is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long
as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this
telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are

> ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a

6th-­‐‑level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10
minutes. When you use a 7th-­‐‑level spell slot, the duration is
concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 8th level or
higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.

#### Dream

> *5th-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** Special
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of sand, a dab of ink, and a
> writing quill plucked from a sleeping bird)
>
> **Duration:** 8 hours

This spell shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as
the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of
existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be
contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a
trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger
is aware of his or her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.

If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams
and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through
the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment
of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The
messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of
the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If
the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and
can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall
asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target’s dreams.

You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the
target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than
ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that
lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents the target from
gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes
up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.

> If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from

a nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target makes its
saving throw with disadvantage.

#### Earthquake

> *8th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 500 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump
> of clay)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can
see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the
ground in a 100-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius circle centered on that point and
shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground in that area.

> The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.

Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s
concentration is broken.

When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend
concentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must make a
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

This spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in the
area, as determined by the GM. ***Fissures.*** Fissures open throughout
the spell’s area at the start of your next turn after you cast the
spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations

chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10 × 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends
from one edge of the spell’s area to the opposite side. A creature
standing on a spot where a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with
the fissure’s edge as it opens.

A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically
collapse (see below).

***Structures.*** The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any
structure in contact with the ground

in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your
turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it
collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within
half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is
knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength
(Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC
higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful
save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or
become buried.

#### Enhance Ability

> *2nd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (fur or a feather from a beast)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour.

You touch a creature and bestow upon it a magical enhancement. Choose
one of the following effects; the target gains that effect until the
spell ends.

***Bear’s Endurance***. The target has advantage on Constitution checks.
It also gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which are lost when the spell
ends.

***Bull’s Strength***. The target has advantage on Strength checks, and
his or her carrying capacity doubles.

***Cat’s Grace***. The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also
doesn’t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn’t
incapacitated.

> ***Eagle’s Splendor***. The target has advantage on Charisma checks.
>
> ***Fox’s Cunning***. The target has advantage on Intelligence checks.
>
> ***Owl’s Wisdom***. The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each
slot level above 2nd.

#### Enlarge/Reduce

> *2nd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow
larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an
object that is neither

worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution
saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.

If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying
changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns
to normal size at once.

***Enlarge.*** The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its
weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one
category— from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn’t enough room
for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the
maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the
target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
The target’s weapons also grow to match its new size. While these
weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra
damage.

***Reduce.*** The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and its
weight is reduced to one-­‐‑eighth of normal. This reduction decreases
its size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. Until the
spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and
Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also shrink to match its
new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target’s attacks with
them deal 1d4 less damage (this can’t reduce the damage below 1).

#### Entangle

> *1st-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 90 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-­‐‑foot square
starting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn
the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

> A creature in the area when you cast the spell

must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the
entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the
plants can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell
save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

> When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.

#### Enthrall

> *2nd-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** 1 minute

You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your
choice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a
Wisdom saving throw. Any creature that can’t be charmed succeeds on this
saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are fighting a
creature, it has advantage on the save. On a failed save, the target has
disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any creature
other than you until the spell ends or until the target can no longer
hear you. The spell ends if you are incapacitated or can no longer
speak.

#### Etherealness

> *7th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Up to 8 hours

You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area
where it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border
Ethereal for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss the
spell. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you move up
or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can see and
hear the plane you originated from, but everything there looks gray, and
you can’t see anything more than 60 feet away.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by
other creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren’t on the Ethereal
Plane can’t perceive you and can’t interact with you, unless a special
ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.

You ignore all objects and effects that aren’t on the Ethereal Plane,
allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the plane you
originated from.

When the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you originated
from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the same spot as a
solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately shunted
to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force
damage equal to twice the number of feet you are moved.

This spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the Ethereal
Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it, such as one of the Outer
Planes.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures
(including you) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures must be
within 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.

#### Expeditious Retreat

> *1st-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

This spell allows you to move at an incredible pace. When you cast this
spell, and then as a bonus action on each of your turns until the spell
ends, you can take the Dash action.

#### Eyebite

> *6th-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the spell’s duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with
dread power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you
can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of
the following effects of your choice for the duration. On each of your
turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to target another
creature but can’t target a creature again if it has succeeded on a
saving throw against this casting of *eyebite.*

***Asleep.*** The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any
damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper
awake.

***Panicked.*** The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns,
the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you
by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to
move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you
where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.

***Sickened.*** The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability
checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom
saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends.

#### Fabricate

> *4th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For
example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope
from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.

Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a
Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-­‐‑foot cube, or eight
connected 5-­‐‑foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material.
If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance,
however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained
within a single 5-­‐‑foot cube). The quality of objects made by the
spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.

Creatures or magic items can’t be created or transmuted by this spell.
You also can’t use it to create items that ordinarily require a high
degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor,
unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan’s tools used to
craft such objects.

#### Faerie Fire

> *1st-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each object in a 20-­‐‑foot cube within range is outlined in blue,
green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the
spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving
throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light
in a 10-­‐‑foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if
the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can’t
benefit from being invisible.

#### Faithful Hound

> *4th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a
> thread)
>
> **Duration:** 8 hours

You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see
within range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as
an

action, or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.

The hound is invisible to all creatures except you and can’t be harmed.
When a Small or larger creature comes within 30 feet of it without first
speaking the password that you specify when you cast this spell, the
hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can
see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.

At the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one
creature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound’s attack
bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency
bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.

#### False Life

> *1st-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a small amount of alcohol or
>
> distilled spirits)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

Bolstering yourself with a necromantic facsimile of life, you gain 1d4 +
4 temporary hit points for the duration.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, you gain 5 additional temporary hit points for each
slot level above 1st.

#### Fear

> *3rd-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self (30-­‐‑foot cone)
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a hen)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You project a phantasmal image of a creature’s worst fears. Each
creature in a 30-­‐‑foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for the duration.

While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and
move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns,
unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a
location where it doesn’t have line of sight to you, the creature can
make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for
that creature.

#### Feather Fall

> *1st-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature
> within 60 feet of you falls
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, M (a small feather or piece of down)
>
> **Duration:** 1 minute

Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature’s
rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If the
creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can
land on its feet, and the spell ends for that creature.

#### Feeblemind

> *8th-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 150 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, glass,
>
> or mineral spheres)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range,
attempting to shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes
4d6 psychic damage and must make an Intelligence saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature’s Intelligence and Charisma scores become
1. The creature can’t cast spells, activate magic items, understand
language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can,
however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect them.

> At the end of every 30 days, the creature can

repeat its saving throw against this spell. If it succeeds on its saving
throw, the spell ends.

> The spell can also be ended by *greater restoration*, *heal*, or
> *wish.*

#### Find Steed

> *2nd-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent,
strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-­‐‑lasting bond with it.
Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed takes on a form
that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff.
(Your GM might allow other

animals to be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the
chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice)
instead of its normal type. Additionally, if your steed has an
Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the
ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.

Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have
an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit.
While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell you cast that
targets only you also target your steed.

When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no
physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action,
causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again
summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.

While your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it
telepathically.

You can’t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an
action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time, causing it
to disappear.

#### Find the Path

> *6th-­‐‑level divination*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a set of divinatory tools— such as bones,
> ivory sticks, cards, teeth, or carved runes—worth 100 gp and an object
> from the location you wish to find)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 day

This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route
to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same
plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane of
existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress), or a
destination that isn’t specific (such as “a green dragon’s lair”), the
spell fails.

For the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence as
the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it lies.
While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with a choice
of paths along the way, you automatically determine which path is the
shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest route) to
the destination.

#### Find Traps

> *2nd-­‐‑level divination*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 120 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of
sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that
would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or
undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator.
Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the *alarm* spell, a
*glyph of warding*, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a
natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden
sinkhole.

> This spell merely reveals that a trap is present.

You don’t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general
nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.

#### Finger of Death

> *7th-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see
within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a
Constitution saving throw. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as
a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your verbal
orders to the best of its ability.

#### Fireball

> *3rd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 150 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose
within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of
flame. Each creature in a 20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on that
point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target

takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the
area that aren’t being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
above 3rd.

#### Fire Shield

> *4th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a
>
> firefly)
>
> **Duration:** 10 minutes

Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding
bright light in a 10-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 10
feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.

> The flames provide you with a warm shield or a

chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to
cold damage, and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a
melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire
damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold shield.

#### Fire Storm

> *7th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 150 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you
choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten
10-­‐‑foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have
at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in
the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 fire damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that
aren’t being worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in the area is
unaffected by this spell.

#### Flame Blade

> *2nd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (leaf of sumac)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size
and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of
the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus
action.

You can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery
blade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage.

The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-­‐‑foot radius and dim
light for an additional 10 feet.

> ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a

spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every
two slot levels above 2nd.

#### Flame Strike

> *5th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (pinch of sulfur)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a
location you specify. Each creature in a 10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius,
40-­‐‑foot-­‐‑high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a
Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 radiant
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice)
increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.

#### Flaming Sphere

> *2nd-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a
> dusting of powdered iron)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A 5-­‐‑foot-­‐‑diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of
your choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that
ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving
throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on

a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the
sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against
the sphere’s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.

When you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet
tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites
flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light
in a 20-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
above 2nd.

#### Flesh to Stone

> *6th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of lime, water, and earth)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into
stone. If the target’s body is made of flesh, the creature must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its
flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn’t
affected.

A creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution
saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves
against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its saves
three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the petrified
condition for the duration. The successes and failures don’t need to be
consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a
kind.

If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from
similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire possible
duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect is removed.

#### Floating Disk

> *1st-­‐‑level conjuration (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in
diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an
unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk
remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight
is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the
ground.

The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move
more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains
within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down
stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation change of
10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a
10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created
at the bottom.

If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can’t
move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

#### Fly

> *3rd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed of 60 feet
for the duration. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still
aloft, unless it can stop the fall.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each
slot level above 3rd.

#### Fog Cloud

> *1st-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 120 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a 20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere of fog centered on a point
within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily
obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or
greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each
slot level above 1st.

#### Forbiddance

> *6th-­‐‑level abjuration (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and
> powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 gp)
>
> **Duration:** 1 day

You create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000
square feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor. For
the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the area or use portals,
such as those created by the *gate* spell, to enter the area. The spell
proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore prevents creatures
from accessing the area by way of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane,
Feywild, Shadowfell, or the *plane shift* spell.

In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose when
you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials,
elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters the
spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the
creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice when you
cast this spell).

When you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature that
speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from the
spell.

The spell’s area can’t overlap with the area of another *forbiddance*
spell. If you cast *forbiddance* every day for 30 days in the same
location, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material
components are consumed on the last casting.

#### Forcecage

> *7th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 100 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

An immobile, invisible, cube-­‐‑shaped prison composed of magical force
springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The
prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is
made from 1/2-­‐‑inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating
a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and
blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.

When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the
cage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or
those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the

center of the area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If the
creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the
cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the
creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature
can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage
also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

> This spell can’t be dispelled by *dispel magic*.

#### Foresight

> *9th-­‐‑level divination*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)
>
> **Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see into
the immediate future. For the duration, the target can’t be surprised
and has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.
Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against
the target for the duration.

This spell immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration
ends.

#### Freedom of Movement

> *4th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a
> similar appendage)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target’s movement is
unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects
can neither reduce the target’s speed nor cause the target to be
paralyzed or restrained.

The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape
from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it
grappled. Finally, being underwater imposes no penalties on the target’s
movement or attacks.

#### Freezing Sphere

> *6th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 300 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of
your choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius
sphere. Each creature within the area must make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6 cold damage. On a
successful save, it takes half as much damage.

If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally
water (not including water-­‐‑based creatures), it freezes the liquid to
a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1
minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen water are
trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action to make a
Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.

You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you
wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch,
appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give the globe
to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling
(to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact, with the same
effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can also set the globe
down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn’t already
shattered, it explodes.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
above 6th.

#### Gaseous Form

> *3rd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of gauze and a wisp of smoke)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it’s
wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell
ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature
isn’t affected.

While in this form, the target’s only method of movement is a flying
speed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another
creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has
advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The
target can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere
cracks, though it treats liquids as though they

were solid surfaces. The target can’t fall and remains hovering in the
air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.

While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can’t talk or manipulate
objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can’t be dropped,
used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can’t attack or cast
spells.

#### Gate

> *9th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least
>
> 5,000 gp)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within
range to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The
portal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in
diameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The
portal lasts for the duration.

The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel
through the portal is possible only by moving through its front.
Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other plane,
appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.

Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this
spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains.

When you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature
(a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that creature is on a
plane other than the one you are on, the portal opens in the named
creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the creature through it to the
nearest unoccupied space on your side of the portal. You gain no special
power over the creature, and it is free to act as the GM deems
appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you.

#### Geas

> *5th-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V
> **Duration:** 30 days

You place a magical command on a creature that you can see within range,
forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some action or
course of

activity as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the
duration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic
damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your
instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t
understand you is unaffected by the spell.

You can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that would
result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command, the spell
ends.

> You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A
> *remove curse*, *greater restoration*, or *wish* spell also ends it.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of
the spells mentioned above.

#### Gentle Repose

> *2nd-­‐‑level necromancy (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed
> on each of the corpse’s eyes, which must remain there for the
> duration)
>
> **Duration:** 10 days

You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is
protected from decay and can’t become undead.

The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target
from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don’t
count against the time limit of spells such as *raise dead.*

#### Giant Insect

> *4th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one
scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the
duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a
giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a
giant scorpion.

Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on
your turn each round. The GM

has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and
movement.

A creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to
0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it.

The GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you
transform a bee, its giant version might have the same statistics as a
giant wasp.

#### Glibness

> *8th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V
> **Duration:** 1 hour

Until the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace
the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say,
magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that
you are being truthful.

#### Globe of Invulnerability

> *6th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self (10-­‐‑foot radius)
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when
> the spell ends)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a
10-­‐‑foot radius around you and remains for the duration.

Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t
affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a
higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects
within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the
area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such
spells.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for
each slot level above 6th.

#### Glyph of Warding

> *3rd-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 hour
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least
> 200 gp, which the spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other
creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor
or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a
scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a
surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10
feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in
its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast
this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being
triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.

You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs
inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or
standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph,
approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the
object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an
object, the most common triggers include opening that object,
approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or
reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under
certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as
height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to
affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions
for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a
certain password.

> When you inscribe the glyph, choose *explosive runes* or a *spell
> glyph.*

***Explosive Runes.*** When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical
energy in a 20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on the glyph. The
sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a
Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire,
lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when
you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Spell Glyph.*** You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower
in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must
target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no
immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the
stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature
that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is
centered

on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or creates
harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the
intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts
until the end of its full duration.

> ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
> 4th level or higher, the damage of an *explosive runes* glyph
> increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a *spell
> glyph*, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot
> you use for the *glyph of warding.*

#### Grease

> *1st-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter)
>
> **Duration:** 1 minute

Slick grease covers the ground in a 10-­‐‑foot square centered on a
point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.

When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed
on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the
area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw or fall prone.

#### Greater Invisibility

> *4th-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends.
Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is
on the target’s person.

#### Greater Restoration

> *5th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (diamond dust worth at least 100 gp, which the
> spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You imbue a creature you touch with positive energy to undo a
debilitating effect. You can reduce the target’s exhaustion level by
one, or end one of the following effects on the target:

-   One effect that charmed or petrified the target

-   One curse, including the target’s attunement to a cursed magic item

-   Any reduction to one of the target’s ability scores

-   One effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum

#### Guards and Wards

> *6th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone
> and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a
> small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)
>
> **Duration:** 24 hours

You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space
(an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-­‐‑foot squares or
twenty-­‐‑five 10-­‐‑foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet
tall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a
stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk into
each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.

When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are
unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also
specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to
these effects.

> *Guards and wards* creates the following effects within the warded
> area.

***Corridors.*** Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily
obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage
offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a
creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite
direction from the one it chooses.

***Doors.*** All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if
sealed by an *arcane lock* spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten
doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of
the *minor illusion* spell) to make them appear as plain sections of
wall.

***Stairs.*** Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to
bottom, as the *web* spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they
are burned or torn away while *guards and wards* lasts.

> ***Other Spell Effect.*** You can place your choice of

one of the following magical effects within the warded area of the
stronghold.

-   Place *dancing lights* in four corridors. You can designate a simple
    > program that the lights repeat as long as *guards and
    > wards* lasts.

-   Place *magic mouth* in two locations.

-   Place *stinking cloud* in two locations. The vapors appear in the
    > places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed
    > by wind while *guards and wards* lasts.

-   Place a constant *gust of wind* in one corridor or room.

-   Place a *suggestion* in one location. You select an area of up to 5
    > feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the
    > area receives the suggestion mentally.

The whole warded area radiates magic. A *dispel magic* cast on a
specific effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting
this spell there every day for one year.

#### Guidance

> *Divination cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target
can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its
choice. It can roll the die before or after making the ability check.
The spell then ends.

#### Guiding Bolt

> *1st-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 120 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 1 round

A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range.
Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target
takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this
target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the
mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
above 1st.

#### Gust of Wind

> *2nd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self (60-­‐‑foot line) **Components:** V, S, M (a legume
> seed) **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a
direction you choose for the spell’s duration. Each creature that starts
its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be
pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.

Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot
it moves when moving closer to you.

The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches,
and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames,
such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance
to extinguish them.

> As a bonus action on each of your turns before the

spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from
you.

#### Hallow

> *5th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 24 hours
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (herbs, oils, and incense worth at least 1,000
> gp, which the spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy (or unholy)
power. The area can have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell fails if
the radius includes an area already under the effect a *hallow* spell.
The affected area is subject to the following effects.

> First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead

can’t enter the area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess
creatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed by
such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon
entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types of
creatures from this effect.

Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect from
the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some of these
effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate whether the
effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a specific deity
or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as orcs or trolls. When
a creature that would be affected enters the spell’s area for the first
time on a turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma saving
throw. On a success, the

creature ignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.

***Courage.*** Affected creatures can’t be frightened while in the area.

> ***Darkness.*** Darkness fills the area. Normal light, as

well as magical light created by spells of a lower level than the slot
you used to cast this spell, can’t illuminate the area.

***Daylight.*** Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness created by
spells of a lower level than the slot you used to cast this spell can’t
extinguish the light.

***Energy Protection.*** Affected creatures in the area have resistance
to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning, piercing, or
slashing.

***Energy Vulnerability.*** Affected creatures in the area have
vulnerability to one damage type of your choice, except for bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing.

> ***Everlasting Rest***. Dead bodies interred in the area can’t be
> turned into undead.
>
> ***Extradimensional Interference.*** Affected creatures can’t move or
> travel using teleportation or by extradimensional or interplanar
> means.

***Fear.*** Affected creatures are frightened while in the area.

***Silence.*** No sound can emanate from within the area, and no sound
can reach into it.

***Tongues.*** Affected creatures can communicate with any other
creature in the area, even if they don’t share a common language.

#### Hallucinatory Terrain

> *4th-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
>
> **Range:** 300 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a stone, a twig, and a bit of green plant)
>
> **Duration:** 24 hours

You make natural terrain in a 150-­‐‑foot cube in range look, sound, and
smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a
road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other
difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a
grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-­‐‑strewn
gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment,
and creatures within the area aren’t changed in appearance.

The tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so creatures
entering the area are likely to see through the illusion. If the
difference isn’t obvious by touch, a creature carefully examining the

illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who discerns the illusion for
what it is, sees it as a vague image superimposed on the terrain.

#### Harm

> *6th-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within
range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a
successful save. The damage can’t reduce the target’s hit points below
1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is
reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took.
Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature’s hit point maximum
to return to normal before that time passes.

#### Haste

> *3rd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell
ends, the target’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has
advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action
on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack
(one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object
action.

> When the spell ends, the target can’t move or take

actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.

#### Heal

> *6th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose a creature that you can see within range. A surge of positive
energy washes through the creature, causing it to regain 70 hit points.
This spell also ends blindness, deafness, and any diseases

affecting the target. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
7th level or higher, the amount of healing increases by 10 for each slot
level above 6th.

#### Healing Word

> *1st-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A creature of your choice that you can see within range regains hit
points equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has
no effect on undead or constructs.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot level
above 1st.

#### Heat Metal

> *2nd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of iron and a flame)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of
heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause
the object to glow red-­‐‑hot. Any creature in physical contact with the
object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell
ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to
cause this damage again.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from
it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the
object if it can. If it doesn’t drop the object, it has disadvantage on
attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
above 2nd.

#### Heroes’ Feast

> *6th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S , M (a gem-­‐‑encrusted bowl worth at least 1,000
> gp, which the spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You bring forth a great feast, including magnificent food and drink. The
feast takes 1 hour to consume and disappears at the end of that time,
and the beneficial effects don’t set in until this hour is over. Up to
twelve other creatures can partake of the feast.

A creature that partakes of the feast gains several benefits. The
creature is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison
and being frightened, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with advantage.
Its hit point maximum also increases by 2d10, and it gains the same
number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours.

#### Heroism

> *1st-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A willing creature you touch is imbued with bravery. Until the spell
ends, the creature is immune to being frightened and gains temporary hit
points equal to your spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each
of its turns. When the spell ends, the target loses any remaining
temporary hit points from this spell.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each
slot level above 1st.

#### Hideous Laughter

> *1st-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (tiny tarts and a feather that is waved in the
> air)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives
everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this
spell affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for the
duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn’t
affected.

> At the end of each of its turns, and each time it

takes damage, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. The
target has advantage on the saving throw if it’s triggered by damage. On
a success, the spell ends.

#### Hold Monster

> *5th-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 90 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a small, straight piece of iron)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed
on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. This spell
has no effect on undead. At the end of each of its turns, the target can
make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the
target.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each
slot level above 5th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other
when you target them.

#### Hold Person

> *2nd-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a small, straight piece of iron)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed
on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of
each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a
success, the spell ends on the target.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
3rd level or higher, you can target one additional humanoid for each
slot level above 2nd. The humanoids must be within 30 feet of each other
when you target them.

#### Holy Aura

> *8th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny reliquary worth at least 1,000 gp
> containing a sacred relic, such as a scrap of cloth from a saint’s
> robe or a piece of parchment from a religious text)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in a
30-­‐‑foot radius around you. Creatures of your choice in that radius
when you cast this spell shed dim light in a 5-­‐‑foot radius and have
advantage on all saving throws, and other

creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the spell
ends. In addition, when a fiend or an undead hits an affected creature
with a melee attack, the aura flashes with brilliant light. The attacker
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the
spell ends.

#### Hypnotic Pattern

> *3rd-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** S, M (a glowing stick of incense or a crystal vial
> filled with phosphorescent material)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air
inside a 30-­‐‑foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment
and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for
the duration. While charmed by this spell, the creature is incapacitated
and has a speed of 0.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if
someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

#### Ice Storm

> *4th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 300 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A hail of rock-­‐‑hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-­‐‑
foot-­‐‑radius, 40-­‐‑foot-­‐‑high cylinder centered on a point within
range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw.
A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6 cold damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn the storm’s area of effect into difficult terrain until
the end of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each
slot level above 4th.

#### Identify

> *1st-­‐‑level divination (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and an owl
> feather)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the
spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-­‐‑imbued object, you
learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires attunement
to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any
spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created
by a spell, you learn which spell created it.

If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn what
spells, if any, are currently affecting it.

#### Illusory Script

> *1st-­‐‑level illusion (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** S, M (a lead-­‐‑based ink worth at least 10 gp, which
> the spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** 10 days

You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing material
and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the duration.

To you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the
writing appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever
meaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing
appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical script that is
unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the writing to appear to be
an entirely different message, written in a different hand and language,
though the language must be one you know.

Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion both
disappear.

A creature with truesight can read the hidden message.

#### Imprisonment

> *9th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in
> the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies
> according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500
> gp per Hit Die of the target)
>
> **Duration:** Until dispelled

You create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see
within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
bound by the spell; if it succeeds, it is immune to this spell if you
cast it again. While affected by this spell, the creature doesn’t need
to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn’t age. Divination spells can’t
locate or perceive the target.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the following forms of
imprisonment.

> ***Burial.*** The target is entombed far beneath the

earth in a sphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain
the target. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature
teleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.

The special component for this version of the spell is a small mithral
orb.

> ***Chaining.*** Heavy chains, firmly rooted in the

ground, hold the target in place. The target is restrained until the
spell ends, and it can’t move or be moved by any means until then.

The special component for this version of the spell is a fine chain of
precious metal.

***Hedged Prison.*** The spell transports the target into a tiny
demiplane that is warded against teleportation and planar travel. The
demiplane can be a labyrinth, a cage, a tower, or any similar confined
structure or area of your choice.

The special component for this version of the spell is a miniature
representation of the prison made from jade.

***Minimus Containment.*** The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch and
is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can pass
through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out and other
creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through, even by means
of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t be cut or broken
while the spell remains in effect.

The special component for this version of the spell is a large,
transparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.

***Slumber.*** The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The special
component for this version of the spell consists of rare soporific
herbs.

***Ending the Spell.*** During the casting of the spell, in any of its
versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell to end
and release the target. The condition can be as specific or as elaborate
as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is reasonable
and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be based on a
creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be based on

observable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as
level, class, or hit points.

A *dispel magic* spell can end the spell only if it is cast as a
9th-­‐‑level spell, targeting either the prison or the special component
used to create it.

You can use a particular special component to create only one prison at
a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the target
of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.

#### Incendiary Cloud

> *8th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 150 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-­‐‑ hot embers appears
in a 20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on a point within range. The
cloud spreads around corners and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the
duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles
per hour) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving
throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving
throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or
ends its turn there.

The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you in a direction that you
choose at the start of each of your turns.

#### Inflict Wounds

> *1st-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit,
the target takes 3d10 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level
above 1st.

#### Insect Plague

> *5th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 300 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain,
> and a smear of fat)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on
a point you choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The
sphere remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The
sphere’s area is difficult terrain.

When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution
saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this
saving throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a
turn or ends its turn there.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level
above 5th.

#### Instant Summons

> *6th-­‐‑level conjuration (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a sapphire worth 1,000 gp)
>
> **Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less whose longest dimension
is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an invisible mark on its surface and
invisibly inscribes the name of the item on the sapphire you use as the
material component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use a
different sapphire.

At any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item’s name
and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand
regardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.

> If another creature is holding or carrying the item,

crushing the sapphire doesn’t transport the item to you, but instead you
learn who the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that
creature is located at that moment.

*Dispel magic* or a similar effect successfully applied to the sapphire
ends this spell’s effect.

#### Invisibility

> *2nd-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends. Anything
the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the
target’s

person. The spell ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each
slot level above 2nd.

#### Irresistible Dance

> *6th-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a
comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the
duration. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this spell.

A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving
its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack
rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have
advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature
makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful
save, the spell ends.

#### Jump

> *1st-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a grasshopper’s hind leg)
>
> **Duration:** 1 minute

You touch a creature. The creature’s jump distance is tripled until the
spell ends.

#### Knock

> *2nd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose an object that you can see within range. The object can be a
door, a box, a chest, a set of manacles, a padlock, or another object
that contains a mundane or magical means that prevents access.

A target that is held shut by a mundane lock or that is stuck or barred
becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. If the object has multiple
locks, only one of them is unlocked.

If you choose a target that is held shut with *arcane lock*, that spell
is suppressed for 10 minutes, during which time the target can be opened
and shut normally.

> When you cast the spell, a loud knock, audible

from as far away as 300 feet, emanates from the target object.

#### Legend Lore

> *5th-­‐‑level divination*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (incense worth at least 250 gp, which the
> spell consumes, and four ivory strips worth at least 50 gp each)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your
mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named.
The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even
secret lore that has never been widely known. If the thing you named
isn’t of legendary importance, you gain no information. The more
information you already have about the thing, the more precise and
detailed the information you receive is.

The information you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative
language. For example, if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the
spell might yield this information: “Woe to the evildoer whose hand
touches the axe, for even the haft slices the hand of the evil ones.
Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin, may awaken the
true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word *Rudnogg* on the
lips.”

#### Lesser Restoration

> *2nd-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature and can end either one disease or one condition
afflicting it. The condition can be blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or
poisoned.

#### Levitate

> *2nd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (either a small leather loop or a piece of
> golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

One creature or object of your choice that you can see within range
rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the
duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds.
An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is
unaffected.

> The target can move only by pushing or pulling

against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a
ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change
the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn.
If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move.
Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain
within the spell’s range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is
still aloft.

#### Light

> *Evocation cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension.
Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-­‐‑foot
radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored
as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks
the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an
action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that
creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

#### Lightning Bolt

> *3rd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self (100-­‐‑foot line)
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or
> glass)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A stroke of lightning forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide
blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line
must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6

lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being
worn or carried.

> ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a

spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each
slot level above 3rd.

#### Locate Animals or Plants

> *2nd-­‐‑level divination (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

Describe or name a specific kind of beast or plant. Concentrating on the
voice of nature in your surroundings, you learn the direction and
distance to the closest creature or plant of that kind within 5 miles,
if any are present.

#### Locate Creature

> *4th-­‐‑level divination*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the
direction to the creature’s location, as long as that creature is within
1,000 feet of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of
its movement.

The spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest
creature of a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as
you have seen such a creature up close—within 30 feet—at least once. If
the creature you described or named is in a different form, such as
being under the effects of a *polymorph* spell, this spell doesn’t
locate the creature.

This spell can’t locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet
wide blocks a direct path between you and the creature.

#### Locate Object

> *2nd-­‐‑level divination*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a forked twig)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the
direction to the object’s location, as long as that object is within
1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of
its movement.

The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have
seen it up close—within 30 feet—at least once. Alternatively, the spell
can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain
kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.

This spell can’t locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin
sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.

#### Longstrider

> *1st-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dirt)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a creature. The target’s speed increases by 10 feet until the
spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each
slot level above 1st.

#### Mage Armor

> *1st-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)
>
> **Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature who isn’t wearing armor, and a protective
magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target’s base AC
becomes 13

+ its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target

dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.

#### Mage Hand

> *Conjuration cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 1 minute

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range.
The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action.
The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if
you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to
manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or
retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a
vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can’t attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10
pounds.

#### Magic Circle

> *3rd-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** 10 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver
>
> and iron worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

You create a 10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius, 20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑tall cylinder of
magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within
range. Glowing runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the
floor or other surface.

Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials,
elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the
chosen type in the following ways:

-   The creature can’t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means.
    > If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel
    > to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.

-   The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within
    > the cylinder.

-   Targets within the cylinder can’t be charmed, frightened, or
    > possessed by the creature.

When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in
the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from
leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
4th level or higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot
level above 3rd.

#### Magic Jar

> *6th-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a gem, crystal, reliquary, or some other
> ornamental container worth at least 500 gp)
>
> **Duration:** Until dispelled

Your body falls into a catatonic state as your soul leaves it and enters
the container you used for the spell’s material component. While your
soul inhabits the container, you are aware of your surroundings as if
you were in the container’s space. You can’t move or use reactions. The
only action you can take is to project your soul up to 100 feet out of
the container, either returning to your living body (and ending the
spell) or attempting to possess a humanoids body.

You can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that you
can see (creatures warded by a *protection from evil and good* or *magic
circle* spell can’t be possessed). The target must make a Charisma
saving throw. On a failure, your soul moves into the target’s body, and
the target’s soul becomes trapped in the container. On a success, the
target resists your efforts to possess it, and you can’t attempt to
possess it again for 24 hours.

Once you possess a creature’s body, you control it. Your game statistics
are replaced by the statistics of the creature, though you retain your
alignment and your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You retain
the benefit of your own class features. If the target has any class
levels, you can’t use any of its class features.

Meanwhile, the possessed creature’s soul can perceive from the container
using its own senses, but it can’t move or take actions at all.

While possessing a body, you can use your action to return from the host
body to the container if it is within 100 feet of you, returning the
host creature’s soul to its body. If the host body dies while you’re in
it, the creature dies, and you must make a Charisma saving throw against
your own spellcasting DC. On a success, you return to the container if
it is within 100 feet of you. Otherwise, you die.

If the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul immediately
returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet away from you
or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to it, you die. If
another creature’s soul is in the container when it is destroyed, the
creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is alive and within 100
feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.

> When the spell ends, the container is destroyed.

#### Magic Missile

> *1st-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 120 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a
creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals 1d4
+ 1 force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and
you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level
above 1st.

#### Magic Mouth

> *2nd-­‐‑level illusion (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a small bit of honeycomb and
>
> jade dust worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Until dispelled

You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is
uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can
see and that isn’t being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak
the message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered
over as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that
will trigger the spell to deliver your message.

When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object and
recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If
the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth
(for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so
that the words appear to come from the object’s mouth. When you cast
this spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or
it can remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.

The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you
like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur
within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth
to speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a
silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.

#### Magic Weapon

> *2nd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You touch a nonmagical weapon. Until the spell ends, that weapon becomes
a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
4th level or higher, the bonus increases to +2. When you use a spell
slot of 6th level or higher, the bonus increases to +3.

#### Magnificent Mansion

> *7th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** 300 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature portal carved from ivory, a small
> piece of polished marble, and a tiny silver spoon, each item worth at
> least 5 gp)
>
> **Duration:** 24 hours

You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the
duration. You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance
shimmers faintly and is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any
creature you designate when you cast the spell can enter the
extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains open. You can
open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While closed,
the portal is invisible.

Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond.
The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.

You can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed 50
cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and
decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a
nine-­‐‑course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100
near-­‐‑transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the
visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are
completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a
normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any
action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can
fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour
wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but can’t
leave it. Furnishings and other objects created by this spell dissipate
into smoke if removed from the mansion. When the spell ends, any
creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled into the open
spaces nearest to the entrance.

#### Major Image

> *3rd-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible
phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-­‐‑foot cube. The image appears
at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It
seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature
appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or
cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or
deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a
troglodyte’s stench).

As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action
to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image
changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements
appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a
creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be
walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds
at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,
because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to
examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the
creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
6th level or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring
your concentration.

#### Mass Cure Wounds

> *5th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice within
range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere
centered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8 +
your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead
or constructs.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level
above 5th.

#### Mass Heal

> *9th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures around
you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose among any
number of creatures that you can see within range. Creatures healed by
this spell are also cured of all diseases and any effect making them
blinded or deafened. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

#### Mass Healing Word

> *3rd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

As you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your choice
that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4 + your
spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or
constructs.

> ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a

spell slot of 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each
slot level above 3rd.

#### Mass Suggestion

> *6th-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb
> or a drop of sweet oil)
>
> **Duration:** 24 hours

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and
magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can
see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that
can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be
worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound
reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a
spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act
automatically negates the effect of the spell.

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it
pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability.
The suggested

course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the suggested
activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when the
subject finishes what it was asked to do.

> You can also specify conditions that will trigger a

special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest
that a group of soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they
meet. If the condition isn’t met before the spell ends, the activity
isn’t performed.

> If you or any of your companions damage a

creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.

***At Higher Levels***. When you cast this spell using a 7th-­‐‑level
spell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-­‐‑level spell
slot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-­‐‑level spell slot,
the duration is a year and a day.

#### Maze

> *8th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine
demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes
the maze.

The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it
makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the
spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).

When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if
that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.

#### Meld into Stone

> *3rd-­‐‑level transmutation (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 8 hours

You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain
your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry with the
stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into the stone at
a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or
otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.

> While merged with the stone, you can’t see what

occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception)

checks you make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage.
You remain aware of the passage of time and can cast spells on yourself
while merged in the stone. You can use your movement to leave the stone
where you entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can’t move.

Minor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm you, but its partial
destruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer
fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The
stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into a different
substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If
expelled, you fall prone in an unoccupied space closest to where you
first entered.

#### Mending

> *Transmutation cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such
as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a
leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot
in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the
spell can’t restore magic to such an object.

#### Message

> *Transmutation cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)
>
> **Duration:** 1 round

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a
message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can
reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with
the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of
stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood
blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and
can travel freely around corners or through openings.

#### Meteor Swarm

> *9th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 1 mile **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you
can see within range. Each creature in a 40-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere
centered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw.
The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and
20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is
affected only once.

The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that
aren’t being worn or carried.

#### Mind Blank

> *8th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 24 hours

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to
psychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its
thoughts, divination spells, and the charmed condition. The spell even
foils *wish* spells and spells or effects of similar power used to
affect the target’s mind or to gain information about the target.

#### Minor Illusion

> *Illusion cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece)
>
> **Duration:** 1 minute

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for
the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or
cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream.
It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of
drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated
throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different
times before the spell ends.

If you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy footprints,
or a small chest—it must be no larger than a 5-­‐‑foot cube. The image
can’t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical
interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things
can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the
creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes
faint to the creature.

#### Mirage Arcane

> *7th-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes **Range:** Sight **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 10 days

You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and
even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain’s general shape
remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to
resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable
terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice
like a gentle slope, or a rock-­‐‑strewn gully like a wide and smooth
road.

Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where
none are present. The spell doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements,
so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or
otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory
terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell’s area
disappears immediately.

Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain’s
true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while
the creature is aware of the illusion’s presence, the creature can still
physically interact with the illusion.

#### Mirror Image

> *2nd-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 1 minute

Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the
spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions,
shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real. You
can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell’s
duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one
of your duplicates.

If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the
attack’s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8
or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.

A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits
a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed
only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects.
The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.

A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see, if it relies on
senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive
illusions as false, as with truesight.

#### Mislead

> *5th-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You become invisible at the same time that an illusory double of you
appears where you are standing. The double lasts for the duration, but
the invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell.

You can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice your
speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were
located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action, you can
switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you
are using its senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own
surroundings.

#### Misty Step

> *2nd-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
>
> **Range:** Self **Components:** V **Duration:** Instantaneous

Briefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an
unoccupied space that you can see.

#### Modify Memory

> *5th-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature that
you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the
creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the
target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is
incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear
you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell
ends, and none of the target’s memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event
that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more
than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event,
allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting
detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a
memory of some other event.

> You must speak to the target to describe how its

memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language
for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in
the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have
finished describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t
altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves,
particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural
inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such
as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself
in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a
modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant
manner.

> A *remove curse* or *greater restoration* spell cast on the target
> restores the creature’s true memory.

***At Higher Levels***. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th
level or higher, you can alter the target’s memories of an event that
took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year
ago

(8th level), or any time in the creature’s past (9th level).

#### Moonbeam

> *2nd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (several seeds of any
>
> moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-­‐‑foot-­‐‑ radius,
40-­‐‑foot-­‐‑high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the
spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or
starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause
searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes
2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it
also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t assume a different
form until it leaves the spell’s light.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action
to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level
above 2nd.

#### Move Earth

> *6th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag
>
> containing a mixture of soils—clay, loam, and sand)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 2 hours

Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within range.
You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner you choose
for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s elevation, create or
fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or form a pillar. The extent
of any such changes can’t exceed half the area’s largest dimension. So,
if you affect a 40-­‐‑foot square, you can create a pillar up to 20 feet
high, raise or lower the square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a
trench up to 20 feet deep, and so

on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.

At the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you
can choose a new area of terrain to affect.

Because the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the
area can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.

This spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks
and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you
shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might collapse.

Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The moved
earth carries any plants along with it.

#### Nondetection

> *3rd-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25 gp sprinkled
> over the target, which the spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** 8 hours

For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from divination
magic. The target can be a willing creature or a place or an object no
larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can’t be targeted by
any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

#### Pass without Trace

> *2nd-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (ashes from a burned leaf of
>
> mistletoe and a sprig of spruce)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your
companions from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose
within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity
(Stealth) checks and can’t be tracked except by magical means. A
creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks or other
traces of its passage.

#### Passwall

> *5th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

A passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a
wooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a
floor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the
opening’s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep.
The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.

> When the opening disappears, any creatures or

objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely ejected to
an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.

#### Phantasmal Killer

> *4th-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 120 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and
create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to
that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each
of the target’s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on
a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save,
the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level
above 4th.

#### Phantom Steed

> *3rd-­‐‑level illusion (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 1 hour

A Large quasi-­‐‑real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an
unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature’s
appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of
the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is
carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The
creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed
of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast

pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1
minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or
if the steed takes any damage.

#### Planar Ally

> *6th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known to
you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of cosmic
power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a fiend loyal to
it to aid you, making the creature appear in an unoccupied space within
range. If you know a specific creature’s name, you can speak that name
when you cast this spell to request that creature, though you might get
a different creature anyway (GM’s choice).

When the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in any
particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in
exchange for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested task
could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us fight a
battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during our foray
into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with the creature to
bargain for its services.

Payment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a sizable
donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a fiend might
demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some creatures might
exchange their service for a quest undertaken by you.

As a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires a
payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires 1,000
gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days) requires 10,000
gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based on the circumstances
under which you cast the spell. If the task is aligned with the
creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or even waived.
Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the suggested payment,
while especially dangerous tasks might require a greater gift. Creatures
rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.

After the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-­‐‑upon
duration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane
after reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if possible.

If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s service, the
creature immediately returns to its home plane.

A creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it,
receiving a full share of experience points awarded.

#### Planar Binding

> *5th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 hour
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the
> spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** 24 hours

With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey,
or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the
entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned
into the center of an inverted *magic circle* in order to keep it
trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the
target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound
to serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created
by another spell, that spell’s duration is extended to match the
duration of this spell.

A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its
ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an
adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature
obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to
you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If
the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell
ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane
of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns
to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a
higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a 6th-­‐‑level
slot, to 30 days with a 7th-­‐‑ level slot, to 180 days with an
8th-­‐‑level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-­‐‑level spell
slot.

#### Plane Shift

> *7th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth at
>
> least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are
transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target
destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental
Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine
Hells, and you appear in or near that destination. If you are trying to
reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of
Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the
Sea of Fire, at the GM’s discretion.

Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle
on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle.
If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you
transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the
circle.

You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane.
Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack
against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If
the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on
the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find
its own way back to your current plane of existence.

#### Plant Growth

> *3rd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action or 8 hours
>
> **Range:** 150 feet **Components:** V, S **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There
are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or
long-­‐‑term benefits.

If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All
normal plants in a 100-­‐‑foot radius centered on that point become
thick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4
feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell’s area
from being affected.

If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in
a half-­‐‑mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched
for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when
harvested.

#### Polymorph

> *4th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a
new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid
the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with
0 hit points.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to
0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge
rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if
it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics,
including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the
chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to
its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had
before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit
points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as
the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit
points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of
its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action
that requires hands or speech.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate,
use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

#### Power Word Kill

> *9th-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see
within range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100 hit
points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

#### Power Word Stun

> *8th-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet

###### Components: V

> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature
you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150
hit points or fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of
each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.

#### Prayer of Healing

> *2nd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

Up to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range each
regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.
This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level
above 2nd.

#### Prestidigitation

> *Transmutation cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 10 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Up to 1 hour

This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for
practice. You create one of the following magical effects within range:

-   You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a
    > shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an
    > odd odor.

-   You instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a
    > small campfire.

-   You instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1
    > cubic foot.

-   You chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving material
    > for 1 hour.

-   You make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or a
    > surface for 1 hour.

-   You create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in
    > your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.

If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its
non-­‐‑instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such
an effect as an action.

#### Prismatic Spray

> *7th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self (60-­‐‑foot cone)
> **Components:** V, S **Duration:** Instantaneous

Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a
different color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature in
a 60-­‐‑foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target,
roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.

1.  ***Red.*** The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or
    > half as much damage on a successful one.

2.  ***Orange.*** The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or
    > half as much damage on a successful one.

3.  ***Yellow.*** The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed
    > save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

4.  ***Green.*** The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save,
    > or half as much damage on a successful one.

5.  ***Blue.*** The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a

failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

1.  ***Indigo.*** On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must
    > then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of
    > its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends.
    > If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone
    > and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and
    > failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until
    > the target collects three of a kind.

2.  ***Violet.*** On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must then
    > make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A
    > successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the
    > creature is transported to another plane of existence of the GM’s
    > choosing and is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is
    > on a plane that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other
    > creatures are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)

3.  ***Special.*** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more,
    > rerolling any 8.

#### Prismatic Wall

> *9th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 10 minutes

A shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque
wall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch thick—centered on a
point you can see within range. Alternatively, you can shape the wall
into a sphere up to 30 feet in diameter centered on a point you choose
within range. The wall remains in place for the duration. If you
position the wall so that it passes through a space occupied by a
creature, the spell fails, and your action and the spell slot are
wasted.

> The wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100

feet and dim light for an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you
designate at the time you cast the spell can pass through and remain
near the wall without harm. If another creature that can see the wall
moves to within 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature
must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1
minute.

The wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When a
creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does so one
layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes or reaches
through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or
be affected by that layer’s properties as described below.

The wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from red
to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is destroyed,
it remains so for the duration of the spell. A *rod of cancellation*
destroys a *prismatic wall*, but an *antimagic field* has no effect on
it.

1.  ***Red.*** The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or
    > half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in
    > place, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The
    > layer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.

2.  ***Orange.*** The creature takes 10d6 acid damage

on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this
layer is in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall.
The layer is destroyed by a strong wind.

1.  ***Yellow.*** The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed
    > save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can
    > be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.

2.  ***Green.*** The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save,
    > or half as much damage on a successful one. A *passwall* spell, or
    > another spell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on
    > a solid surface, destroys this layer.

3.  ***Blue.*** The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or
    > half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be
    > destroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.

4.  ***Indigo.*** On a failed save, the creature is restrained. It must
    > then make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of
    > its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends.
    > If it fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone
    > and is subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and
    > failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until
    > the creature collects three of a kind.

> While this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast

through the wall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a
*daylight* spell or a similar spell of equal or higher level.

1.  ***Violet.*** On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must
    > then make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A
    > successful save ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the
    > creature is transported to another plane of the GM’s choosing and
    > is no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane
    > that isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures
    > are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer
    > is destroyed by a *dispel magic* spell or a similar spell of equal
    > or higher level that can end spells and magical effects.

#### Private Sanctum

> *4th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque
> glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)
>
> **Duration:** 24 hours

You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that
can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The
spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.

When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell
provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:

-   Sound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.

-   The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing
    > vision (including darkvision) through it.

-   Sensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the
    > protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.

-   Creatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells.

-   Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.

-   Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. Casting this spell
    > on the same spot every day for a

year makes this effect permanent.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet
for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can
be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.

#### Produce Flame

> *Conjuration cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the
duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds
bright light in a 10-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 10
feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it
again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell.
When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl
the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell
attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8),
11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Programmed Illusion

> *6th-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least
> 25 gp)
>
> **Duration:** Until dispelled

You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible
phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs.
The

illusion is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a
30-­‐‑foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the illusion
behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up
to 5 minutes.

When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into
existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the illusion
finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes.
After this time, the illusion can be activated again.

> The triggering condition can be as general or as

detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible
conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could
create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt
to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only
when a creature says the correct word or phrase.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,
because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to
examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

#### Project Image

> *7th-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 500 miles
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a small replica of you made from materials
> worth at least 5 gp)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 day

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The
copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before,
regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like
you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears,
and the spell ends.

> You can use your action to move this illusion up to

twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way
you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in
its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its
senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses,
you are blinded and deafened in regard to your own surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,
because things can pass through it. A

creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it
is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check
against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what
it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes
sounds hollow to the creature.

#### Protection from Energy

> *3rd-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

For the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to one
damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.

#### Protection from Evil and Good

> *1st-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which
> the spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected
against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals,
fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have
disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t
be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already
charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has
advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

#### Protection from Poison

> *2nd-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the poison. If
more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison that
you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.

> For the duration, the target has advantage on

saving throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to poison
damage.

#### Purify Food and Drink

> *1st-­‐‑level transmutation (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 10 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

All nonmagical food and drink within a 5-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere
centered on a point of your choice within range is purified and rendered
free of poison and disease.

#### Raise Dead

> *5th-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 hour
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the
> spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been
dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature’s soul is both willing and
at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit
point.

This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases
that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn’t,
however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these
aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when
the creature returns to life. The spell can’t return an undead creature
to life.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing body
parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its
survival—its head, for instance—the spell automatically fails.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to
all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the
target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it
disappears.

#### Ray of Enfeeblement

> *2nd-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a
creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On
a hit, the

target deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength
until the spell ends.

At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can make a Constitution
saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.

#### Ray of Frost

> *Evocation cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A frigid beam of blue-­‐‑white light streaks toward a creature within
range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes
1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of
your next turn.

The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th
level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Regenerate

> *7th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The
target regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the
target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit
points each minute).

The target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if
any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold
it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit to
the stump.

#### Reincarnate

> *5th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 hour
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000
> gp, which the spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that
the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new
adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body.

If the target’s soul isn’t free or willing to do so, the spell fails.

The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely
causes the creature’s race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and consults
the following table to determine what form the creature takes when
restored to life, or the GM chooses a form.

> **d100 Race**
>
> 01–04 Dragonborn
>
> 05–13 Dwarf, hill
>
> 14–21 Dwarf, mountain
>
> 22–25 Elf, dark
>
> 26–34 Elf, high
>
> 35–42 Elf, wood
>
> 43–46 Gnome, forest
>
> 47–52 Gnome, rock
>
> 53–56 Half-­‐elf
>
> 57–60 Half-­‐orc
>
> 61–68 Halfling, lightfoot
>
> 69–76 Halfling, stout
>
> 77–96 Human
>
> 97–00 Tiefling

The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It
retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it
exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial
traits accordingly.

#### Remove Curse

> *3rd-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the
object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks
its owner’s attunement to the object so it can be removed or discarded.

#### Resilient Sphere

> *4th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a
> matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size
or smaller within range. An

unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature is enclosed for the duration.

Nothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell effects—can pass
through the barrier, in or out, though a creature in the sphere can
breathe there. The sphere is immune to all damage, and a creature or
object inside can’t be damaged by attacks or effects originating from
outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage anything outside
it.

> The sphere is weightless and just large enough to

contain the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its
action to push against the sphere’s walls and thus roll the sphere at up
to half the creature’s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and
moved by other creatures.

A *disintegrate* spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming
anything inside it.

#### Resistance

> *Abjuration cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature cloak)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target
can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its
choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The
spell then ends.

#### Resurrection

> *7th-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 hour
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, which the
> spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century,
that didn’t die of old age, and that isn’t undead. If its soul is free
and willing, the target returns to life with all its hit points.

This spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases afflicting
the creature when it died. It doesn’t, however, remove magical diseases,
curses, and the like; if such effects aren’t removed prior to casting
the spell, they afflict the target on its return to life.

This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to
all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the
target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it
disappears.

Casting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead for
one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long rest, you
can’t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all attack rolls,
ability checks, and saving throws.

#### Reverse Gravity

> *7th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 100 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell reverses gravity in a 50-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius, 100-­‐‑ foot high
cylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects
that aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward and
reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make
a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, thus
avoiding the fall.

If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall,
falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would during a
normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the
area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly,
for the duration.

At the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back
down.

#### Revivify

> *3rd-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell
> consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature
returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can’t return to life a
creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body
parts.

#### Rope Trick

> *2nd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of
> parchment)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the
rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to
the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to
an extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.

The extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of the
rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller creatures.
The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear from
view outside the space.

Attacks and spells can’t cross through the entrance into or out of the
extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if through
a 3-­‐‑foot-­‐‑by-­‐‑5-­‐‑ foot window centered on the rope.

Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell
ends.

#### Sacred Flame

> *Evocation cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

Flame-­‐‑like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within
range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8
radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving
throw.

The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th
level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Sanctuary

> *1st-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a small silver mirror)
>
> **Duration:** 1 minute

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends,
any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful
spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This
spell doesn’t protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the
explosion of a fireball.

If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an
enemy creature, this spell ends.

#### Scorching Ray

> *2nd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 120 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You
can hurl them at one target or several.

> Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit,

the target takes 2d6 fire damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level
above 2nd.

#### Scrying

> *5th-­‐‑level divination*
>
> **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000
>
> gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with
> holy water)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the
same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving
throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of
physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you’re casting
this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be
observed.

> **Knowledge Save Modifier**
>
> Secondhand (you have heard of the target) +5 Firsthand (you have met
> the target) +0
>
> Familiar (you know the target well) −5
>
> **Connection Save Modifier**
>
> Likeness or picture −2
>
> Possession or garment −4
>
> Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like −10

On a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use this
spell against it again for 24 hours.

> On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible

sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the
sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining
within 10 feet of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible
objects sees the sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

> Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a

location you have seen before as the target of this

spell. When you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn’t
move.

#### Secret Chest

> *4th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (an exquisite chest, 3 feet by 2
>
> feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000
> gp, and a Tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 50
> gp)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must
touch the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material
component for the spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of
nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).

While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action and
touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied space
on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the
Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the
replica.

After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the
spell’s effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if
the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the
spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger chest is on the
Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.

#### See Invisibility

> *2nd-­‐‑level divination*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of
> powdered silver)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they
were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal
creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.

#### Seeming

> *5th-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 8 hours

This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of
creatures that you can see within

range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An
unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds,
it is unaffected by this spell.

> The spell disguises physical appearance as well as

clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem
1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t
change a target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same
basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up
to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to
dismiss it sooner.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical
inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a
creature’s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches
it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and hair. If you
use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who
reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly
still in midair.

A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it
succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

#### Sending

> *3rd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Unlimited
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire)
>
> **Duration:** 1 round

You send a short message of twenty-­‐‑five words or less to a creature
with which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its mind,
recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a like
manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with Intelligence scores
of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your message.

You can send the message across any distance and even to other planes of
existence, but if the target is on a different plane than you, there is
a 5 percent chance that the message doesn’t arrive.

#### Sequester

> *7th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby,
> and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Until dispelled

By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be hidden
away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the spell and
touch the target, it becomes invisible and can’t be targeted by
divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by
divination spells.

> If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of

suspended animation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow
older.

You can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition can be
anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1 mile of
the target. Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the tarrasque
awakens.” This spell also ends if the target takes any damage.

#### Shapechange

> *9th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which
> you must place on your head before you cast the spell)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The new
form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to your level
or lower. The creature can’t be a construct or an undead, and you must
have seen the sort of creature at least once. You transform into an
average example of that creature, one without any class levels or the
Spellcasting trait.

Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen
creature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and
Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw
proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the
creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed in its
statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in place of
yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions of the new
form.

> You assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new

form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of
hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of
dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal
form. As long as the excess

damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t
knocked unconscious.

You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other
source and can use them, provided that your new form is physically
capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses you have (for
example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that sense. You can
only speak if the creature can normally speak.

When you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the
ground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment
functions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for the
new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and
size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match the new form,
and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the
ground or merge into your new form. Equipment that merges has no effect
in that state.

During this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a
different form following the same restrictions and rules for the
original form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit points
than your current one, your hit points remain at their current value.

#### Shatter

> *2nd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point of
your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere
centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature
takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone,
crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

A nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the
damage if it’s in the spell’s area.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
above 2nd.

#### Shield

> *1st-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an
> attack or targeted by the *magic missile* spell
>
> **Range:** Self
>
> **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** 1 round

An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until
the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including
against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from *magic
missile.*

#### Shield of Faith

> *1st-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a small parchment with a bit of holy text
> written on it)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice
within range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.

#### Shillelagh

> *Transmutation cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or
> quarterstaff)
>
> **Duration:** 1 minute

The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with
nature’s power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability
instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks
using that weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes a d8. The weapon
also becomes magical, if it isn’t already. The spell ends if you cast it
again or if you let go of the weapon.

#### Shocking Grasp

> *Evocation cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Touch **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you
try to touch. Make a melee spell

attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the
target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8
lightning damage, and it can’t take reactions until the start of its
next turn.

The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th
level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Silence

> *2nd-­‐‑level illusion (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 120 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a
20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range.
Any creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder
damage, and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it. Casting a
spell that includes a verbal component is impossible there.

#### Silent Image

> *1st-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fleece)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible
phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-­‐‑foot cube. The image appears
at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely
visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within
range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so
that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you
create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so
that it appears to be walking.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,
because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to
examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
through the image.

#### Simulacrum

> *7th-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 12 hours
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to made
> a life-­‐‑size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail
> clippings, or other piece of that creature’s body placed inside the
> snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the
> duplicate and consumed by the spell)
>
> **Duration:** Until dispelled

You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within
range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a
creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take
actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It appears to be
the same as the original, but it has half the creature’s hit point
maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion
uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates.

> The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures

you designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in
accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The
simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it
never increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended
spell slots.

> If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in

an alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per
hit point it regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit
points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.

If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you
created with this spell are instantly destroyed.

#### Sleep

> *1st-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 90 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a
> cricket)
>
> **Duration:** 1 minute

This spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total
is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures
within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are affected in
ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious
creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each
creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the spell ends,
the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the
sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points from the total before
moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s
hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that
creature to be affected.

Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this
spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level above
1st.

#### Sleet Storm

> *3rd-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 150 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a
20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑tall cylinder with a 40-­‐‑foot radius centered on a point
you choose within range. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed
flames in the area are doused.

> The ground in the area is covered with slick ice,

making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell’s area for
the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.

If a creature is concentrating in the spell’s area, the creature must
make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC
or lose concentration.

#### Slow

> *3rd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of molasses)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-­‐‑foot
cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target’s speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to AC and
Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions. On its turn, it can
use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the

creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make more than one melee
or ranged attack during its turn.

If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1
action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take effect
until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its action on
that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t, the spell is wasted.

A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at
the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.

#### Speak with Animals

> *1st-­‐‑level divination (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 10 minutes

You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts
for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited
by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information
about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can
perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to
persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM’s
discretion.

#### Speak with Dead

> *3rd-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 10 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (burning incense)
>
> **Duration:** 10 minutes

You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your
choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The
corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if
the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.

Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The
corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew.
Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is
under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it
or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the
creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse
can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend

anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about
future events.

#### Speak with Plants

> *3rd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self (30-­‐‑foot radius)
> **Components:** V, S **Duration:** 10 minutes

You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and
animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow
your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the
spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures
that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.

You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as
thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the
duration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into
difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines and
branches to hinder pursuers, for example.

Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the GM’s
discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and
move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if
you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to
influence it.

> This spell can cause the plants created by the

*entangle* spell to release a restrained creature.

#### Spider Climb

> *2nd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the ability
to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along
ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also gains a climbing
speed equal to its walking speed.

#### Spike Growth

> *2nd-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 150 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each
> sharpened to a point)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The ground in a 20-­‐‑foot radius centered on a point within range
twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult
terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area,
it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

> The transformation of the ground is camouflaged

to look natural. Any creature that can’t see the area at the time the
spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell
save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

#### Spirit Guardians

> *3rd-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self (15-­‐‑foot radius) **Components:** V, S, M (a holy
> symbol) **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a
distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their
spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil,
they appear fiendish.

> When you cast this spell, you can designate any

number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. An affected
creature’s speed is halved in the area, and when the creature enters the
area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make
a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant
damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you are
evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
above 3rd.

#### Spiritual Weapon

> *2nd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V,
> S **Duration:** 1 minute

You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the
duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell,
you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of
the

weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your
spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet
and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are
associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his
mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell’s effect resemble that
weapon.

> ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a

spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every
two slot levels above 2nd.

#### Stinking Cloud

> *3rd-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 90 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas
centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and
its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the
duration.

Each creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its
turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed
save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and reeling.
Creatures that don’t need to breathe or are immune to poison
automatically succeed on this saving throw.

> A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour)

disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per
hour) disperses it after 1 round.

#### Stone Shape

> *4th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly
> the desired shape of the stone object)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone
no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that
suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a
weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long
as the wall is less

than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to
seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and
a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn’t possible.

#### Stoneskin

> *4th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell
> consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

This spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard as
stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to nonmagical
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

#### Storm of Vengeance

> *9th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Sight **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and
spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area,
thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no
more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6
thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes.

Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces
additional effects on your turn.

***Round 2.*** Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and
object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.

***Round 3.*** You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike
six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given
creature or object can’t be struck by more than one bolt. A struck
creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6
lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

***Round 4.*** Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under
the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

***Round 5–10.*** Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the
cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each
creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in

the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction
for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts
of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically
disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane
or magical.

#### Suggestion

> *2nd-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb
> or a drop of sweet oil)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and
magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear
and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this
effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the
course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself,
throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously
harmful act ends the spell.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues
the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The
suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the
suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends
when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity
during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give
her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn’t met
before the spell expires, the activity isn’t performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.

#### Sunbeam

> *6th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Self (60-­‐‑foot line) **Components:** V, S, M (a
> magnifying glass) **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a
5-­‐‑foot-­‐‑wide, 60-­‐‑foot-­‐‑long line. Each creature in the line
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn. On a
successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by

this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until
the spell ends.

> For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance

shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-­‐‑foot radius and
dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.

#### Sunburst

> *8th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 150 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-­‐‑foot radius centered on a point
you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6
radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it
takes half as much damage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and
oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw
at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer
blinded.

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.

#### Symbol

> *7th-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and
> opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell
> consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a
surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an
object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a
scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can
cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you
choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is
moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is
broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.

The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation)
check against your spell save DC to find it.

You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs
inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or
stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching
within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds
it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are
opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or
seeing or reading the glyph.

You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under
certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical
characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for
example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can
also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who
say a certain password.

> When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the

options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a
60-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which
time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph
activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the
sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

***Death.*** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking
10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful save.

***Discord.*** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures for 1
minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful communication
and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

***Fear.*** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes
frightened for 1 minute on a failed save. While frightened, the target
drops whatever it is holding and must move at least 30 feet away from
the glyph on each of its turns, if able.

***Hopelessness.*** Each target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a
failed save, the target is overwhelmed with despair for 1 minute. During
this time, it can’t attack or target any creature with harmful
abilities, spells, or other magical effects.

***Insanity.*** Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a
failed save, the target is driven insane for 1 minute. An insane
creature can’t take actions, can’t understand what other creatures say,
can’t read, and speaks only in gibberish. The GM controls its movement,
which is erratic.

***Pain.*** Each target must make a Constitution saving throw and
becomes incapacitated with excruciating pain for 1 minute on a failed
save.

***Sleep.*** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and falls
unconscious for 10 minutes on a failed save. A creature awakens if it
takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.

***Stunning.*** Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes
stunned for 1 minute on a failed save.

#### Telekinesis

> *5th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by
thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the
duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can
see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect
the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If
you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

***Creature.*** You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an
ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the creature’s
Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30
feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of this
spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in
your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in
mid-­‐‑air.

On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain
your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.

***Object.*** You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000
pounds. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically
move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this
spell.

If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability
check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature’s
Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that
creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond
the range of this spell.

You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such
as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or
retrieving

an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial.

#### Telepathic Bond

> *5th-­‐‑level divination (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (pieces of eggshell from two
>
> different kinds of creatures)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

You forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of your
choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all the others
for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or less aren’t
affected by this spell.

Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically through
the bond whether or not they have a common language. The communication
is possible over any distance, though it can’t extend to other planes of
existence.

#### Teleport

> *7th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 10 feet **Components:** V
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of
your choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you
can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an
object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a 10-­‐‑foot cube, and it
can’t be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the
same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination
determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM rolls d100 and
consults the table.

***Familiarity.*** “Permanent circle” means a permanent teleportation
circle whose sigil sequence you know. “Associated object” means that you
possess an object taken from the desired destination within the last six
months, such as a book from a wizard’s library, bed linen from a royal
suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich’s secret tomb.

“Very familiar” is a place you have been very often, a place you have
carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. “Seen
casually” is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you
aren’t very familiar. “Viewed once” is a place you have seen once,
possibly using magic. “Description” is a place whose location and
appearance you know through someone else’s description, perhaps from a
map.

> “False destination” is a place that doesn’t exist.

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an
illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that
no longer exists.

***On Target.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear where
you want to.

***Off Target.*** You and your group (or the target object) appear a
random distance away from the destination in a random direction.
Distance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance that was to
be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed off
target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off
target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM determines the direction off
target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as
northeast, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you
were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you
could be in trouble.

***Similar Area.*** You and your group (or the target object) wind up in
a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to the target
area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you
might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in

> **Familiarity Mishap**
>
> **Similar Area**
>
> **Off Target**
>
> **On Target**

an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same

tools and implements as your laboratory. Generally,

> Permanent circle Associated object
>
> — — — 01–100
>
> — — — 01–100

you appear in the closest similar place, but since the

spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the
plane.

> ***Mishap.*** The spell’s unpredictable magic results in
>
> Very familiar 01–05 06–13 14–24 25–100
>
> Seen casually 01–33 34–43 44–53 54–100
>
> Viewed once 01–43 44–53 54–73 74–100
>
> Description 01–43 44–53 54–73 74–100

a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the

target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table
to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage
each

time).

#### Teleportation Circle

> *5th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** 10 feet
>
> **Components:** V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems
> with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** 1 round

As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑diameter circle on the
ground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent
teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and
that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens
within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next
turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5
feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if
that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent
teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each
such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a string of magical runes
arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to
cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on
the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil
sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to
memory after studying it for 1 minute.

> You can create a permanent teleportation circle by

casting this spell in the same location every day for one year. You need
not use the circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.

#### Thaumaturgy

> *Transmutation cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** V
> **Duration:** Up to 1 minute

You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range.
You create one of the following magical effects within range:

-   Your voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.

-   You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for
    > 1 minute.

-   You cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.

-   You create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of
    > your choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of
    > a raven, or ominous whispers.

-   You instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open or
    > slam shut.

-   You alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute. If you cast this
    > spell multiple times, you can have up

to three of its 1-­‐‑minute effects active at a time, and

you can dismiss such an effect as an action.

#### Thunderwave

> *1st-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self (15-­‐‑foot cube)
> **Components:** V, S **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a
15-­‐‑foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is
pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes
half as much damage and isn’t pushed.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of
effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell’s
effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
above 1st.

#### Time Stop

> *9th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time
passes for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row,
during which you can use actions and move as normal.

This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any
effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other
than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you.
In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet
from the location where you cast it.

#### Tiny Hut

> *3rd-­‐‑level evocation (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** Self (10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius hemisphere) **Components:** V,
> S, M (a small crystal bead) **Duration:** 8 hours

A 10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius immobile dome of force springs into existence
around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell
ends if you leave its area.

Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with
you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than
nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this
spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are
barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can’t
extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the
space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.

Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit
or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose,
but it is transparent from the inside.

#### Tongues

> *3rd-­‐‑level divination*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, M (a small clay model of a ziggurat)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

This spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand any
spoken language it hears. Moreover, when the target speaks, any creature
that knows at least one language and can hear the target understands
what it says.

#### Transport via Plants

> *6th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 10 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 1 round

This spell creates a magical link between a Large or larger inanimate
plant within range and another plant, at any distance, on the same plane
of existence. You must have seen or touched the destination plant at
least once before. For the duration, any creature can step into the
target plant and exit from the destination plant by using 5 feet of
movement.

#### Tree Stride

> *5th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside
another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living
and at least the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to
enter a tree. You instantly know the location of all other trees of the
same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used to enter the
tree, can either pass into one of those trees or step out of the tree
you’re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within 5 feet of the
destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have no
movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.

You can use this transportation ability once per round for the duration.
You must end each turn outside a tree.

#### True Polymorph

> *9th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic,
> and a wisp of smoke)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range.
You transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into
an object, or the object into a creature (the object must be neither
worn nor carried by another creature). The transformation lasts for the
duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you
concentrate on this spell for the full duration, the transformation
lasts until it is dispelled.

This spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit
points. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it
succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.

***Creature into Creature.*** If you turn a creature into another kind
of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose challenge
rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its level, if the
target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics,
including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the
new form. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts
to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it
had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0
hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long
as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit
points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of
its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action
that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable of such
actions.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate,
use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

***Object into Creature.*** You can turn an object into any kind of
creature, as long as the creature’s size is no larger than the object’s
size and the creature’s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The creature is
friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your turns. You
decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM has the creature’s
statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement.

> If the spell becomes permanent, you no longer

control the creature. It might remain friendly to you, depending on how
you have treated it.

***Creature into Object.*** If you turn a creature into an object, it
transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into that
form. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and the
creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends
and it returns to its normal form.

#### True Resurrection

> *9th-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 hour
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth
> at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
>
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years and
that died for any reason except old age. If the creature’s soul is free
and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its hit points.

This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all
diseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died. The
spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.

The spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer exists,
in which case you must speak the creature’s name. The creature then
appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10 feet of you.

#### True Seeing

> *6th-­‐‑level divination*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (an ointment for the eyes that costs 25 gp; is
> made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat; and is consumed by the
> spell)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

This spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see
things as they actually are. For the duration, the creature has
truesight, notices secret doors hidden by magic, and can see into the
Ethereal Plane, all out to a range of 120 feet.

#### True Strike

> *Divination cantrip*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 30 feet **Components:** S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round

You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic
grants you a brief insight into the target’s defenses. On your next
turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target,
provided that this spell hasn’t ended.

#### Unseen Servant

> *1st-­‐‑level conjuration (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs
simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs
into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has
AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can’t attack. If it
drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.

> Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you

can mentally command the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with
an object. The servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant
could do,

such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting
fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the
servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes
the task, then waits for your next command.

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more
than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

#### Vampiric Touch

> *3rd-­‐‑level necromancy*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The touch of your shadow-­‐‑wreathed hand can siphon life force from
others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a creature
within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and
you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.
Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your
turns as an action.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
above 3rd.

#### Wall of Fire

> *4th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of phosphorus)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make
the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed
wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall
is opaque and lasts for the duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire
damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals
5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of
that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it
enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The
other side of the wall deals no damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level
above 4th.

#### Wall of Force

> *5th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear
> gemstone)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose
within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a
horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating
or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome
or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat
surface made up of ten 10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑by-­‐‑10-­‐‑foot panels. Each panel
must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch
thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature’s
space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall
(your choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage
and can’t be dispelled by *dispel magic.* A *disintegrate* spell
destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the
Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.

#### Wall of Ice

> *6th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form
it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet,
or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑square
panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form,
the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.

If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the
creature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make
a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold
damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC
12 and 30 hit points per 10-­‐‑foot section, and it is vulnerable to
fire damage. Reducing a 10-­‐‑foot section of wall to 0 hit points
destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the
wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the
first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That
creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
on a successful one.

> ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a

spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it
appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet
of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.

#### Wall of Stone

> *5th-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a small block of granite)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you
choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten
10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑ by-­‐‑10-­‐‑foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous
with at least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create
10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑by-­‐‑20-­‐‑foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.

If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the
creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature
would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another
solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is
no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the same
space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be vertical or
rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly
supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a
chasm or create a ramp.

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the
size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to
create crenellations, battlements, and so on.

The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus
breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness.
Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected
panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration,
the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall
disappears when the spell ends.

#### Wall of Thorns

> *6th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of thorns)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with
needle-­‐‑sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface
and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet
long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-­‐‑foot
diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks
line of sight.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8 piercing
damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For
every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of
movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall on a
turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Dexterity saving
throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of
7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot
level above 6th.

#### Warding Bond

> *2nd-­‐‑level abjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** Touch
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp
> each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic
connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the
target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving
throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes
damage, you take the same amount of damage.

> The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you

and the target become separated by more than 60

feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected
creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.

#### Water Breathing

> *3rd-­‐‑level transmutation (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)
>
> **Duration:** 24 hours

This spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within range
the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends. Affected
creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.

#### Water Walk

> *3rd-­‐‑level transmutation (ritual)*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cork)
>
> **Duration:** 1 hour

This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface—such as
water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were harmless solid
ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the
heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this
ability for the duration.

If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the
target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round.

#### Web

> *2nd-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 60 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your choice
within range. The webs fill a 20-­‐‑ foot cube from that point for the
duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.

If the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or
trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web
collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn.
Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them
during its turn must make a

Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as
long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength
check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer
restrained.

The webs are flammable. Any 5-­‐‑foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns
away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its
turn in the fire.

#### Weird

> *9th-­‐‑level illusion*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 120 feet **Components:** V, S
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute

Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create
illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature
in a 30-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on a point of your choice
within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the
creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an
implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s
turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic
damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

#### Wind Walk

> *6th-­‐‑level transmutation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 minute
>
> **Range:** 30 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (fire and holy water)
>
> **Duration:** 8 hours

You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a
gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in
this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has
resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a
creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its
normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is
incapacitated and can’t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can
revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-­‐‑minute
transformation.

If a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the
creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which
it does safely. If it

can’t land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance.

#### Wind Wall

> *3rd-­‐‑level evocation*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 120 feet
>
> **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of
>
> exotic origin)
>
> **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within
range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1
foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it
makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the
duration.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a
Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

> The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases

at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through
the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward.
Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind
the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled
by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.)
Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass through it.

#### Wish

> *9th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** Self **Components:** V
> **Duration:** Instantaneous

*Wish* is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By simply
speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord
with your desires.

The basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level
or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell,
including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.

Alternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your
choice:

-   You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a
    > magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any
    > dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on
    > the ground.

-   You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit
    > points, and you end all effects on them described in the *greater
    > restoration* spell.

-   You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a
    > damage type you choose.

-   You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell
    > or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make
    > yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life
    > drain attack.

-   You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made
    > within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes
    > itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a *wish* spell
    > could undo an opponent’s successful save, a foe’s critical hit, or
    > a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with
    > advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the
    > reroll or the original roll.

You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above
examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has
great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater
the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This
spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly
achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of
how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead
might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no
longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing
for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to
the presence of the item’s current owner.

The stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than
duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each
time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10
necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or
prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t
3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend
resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining
recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance
that you are unable to cast *wish* ever again if you suffer this stress.

#### Word of Recall

> *6th-­‐‑level conjuration*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action
>
> **Range:** 5 feet

###### Components: V

> **Duration:** Instantaneous

You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly
teleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures
that teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the
spot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you
cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no
effect.

You must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a location,
such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your deity. If you
attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that isn’t dedicated
to your deity, the spell has no effect.

#### Zone of Truth

> *2nd-­‐‑level enchantment*
>
> **Casting Time:** 1 action **Range:** 60 feet **Components:** V, S
> **Duration:** 10 minutes

You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a
15-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within
range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for
the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a deliberate lie
while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on
its saving throw.

An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering
questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature
can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the
boundaries of the truth.

Appendix A: Conditions
======================

Conditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can
arise as a result of a spell, a class

feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most

conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as
invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is
countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by
the effect that imposed the condition.

> If multiple effects impose the same condition on a

creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the
condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition
or doesn’t.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is
subjected to a condition.

#### Blinded

-   A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability
    > check that requires sight.

-   Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s
    > attack rolls have disadvantage.

#### Charmed

-   A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer
    > with harmful abilities or magical effects.

-   The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially
    > with the creature.

#### Deafened

-   A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability
    > check that requires hearing.

##### Exhaustion

> Some special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation
> and the long-­‐term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can
> lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured
> in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of
> exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.
>
> **Level Effect**

1.  Disadvantage on ability checks

2.  Speed halved

3.  Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws

4.  Hit point maximum halved

5.  Speed reduced to 0

6.  Death

> If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes
> exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount
> specified in the effect’s description.
>
> A creature suffers the effect of its current level of
>
> exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature
> suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage
> on ability checks.
>
> An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as
>
> specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects
> ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.
>
> Finishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1,
> provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.

#### Frightened

-   A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack
    > rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.

-   The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

#### Grappled

-   A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any
    > bonus to its speed.

-   The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see
    > the condition).

-   The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature
    > from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a
    > creature is hurled away by the *thunder-­‐‑wave* spell.

#### Incapacitated

-   An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.

#### Invisible

-   An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic
    > or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is
    > heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any
    > noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.

-   Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the
    > creature’s attack rolls have advantage.

#### Paralyzed

-   A paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t
    > move or speak.

-   The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity
    > saving throws.

-   Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

-   Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker
    > is within 5 feet of the creature.

#### Petrified

-   A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical
    > object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance
    > (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it
    > ceases aging.

-   The creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or
    > speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.

-   Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

-   The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity
    > saving throws.

-   The creature has resistance to all damage.

-   The creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or
    > disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.

#### Poisoned

-   A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and
    > ability checks.

#### Prone

-   A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it
    > stands up and thereby ends the condition.

-   The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.

-   An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is
    > within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll
    > has disadvantage.

#### Restrained

-   A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from
    > any bonus to its speed.

-   Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s
    > attack rolls have disadvantage.

-   The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

#### Stunned

-   A stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move,
    > and can speak only falteringly.

-   The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity
    > saving throws.

-   Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

#### Unconscious

-   An unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t
    > move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings

-   The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone.

-   The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity
    > saving throws.

-   Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

-   Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker
    > is within 5 feet of the creature.

> **Fantasy-Historical Pantheons**

The Celtic, Egyptian, Greek, and Norse pantheons are fantasy
interpretations of historical religions from our world’s ancient times.
They include deities that are most appropriate for use in a game,
divorced from their historical context in the real world and united into
pantheons that serve the needs of the game.

#### The Celtic Pantheon

It’s said that something wild lurks in the heart of every soul, a space
that thrills to the sound of geese calling at night, to the whispering
wind through the pines, to the unexpected red of mistletoe on an oak—and
it is in this space that the Celtic gods dwell. They sprang from the
brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and
the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared
put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling
in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being.

The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they
are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.

#### The Greek Pantheon

The gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of waves
against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the
cloud-­‐‑enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-­‐‑infested woods and the
sere, olive-­‐‑covered hillsides hold evidence of their passing. Every
aspect of nature echoes with their presence, and they’ve made a place
for themselves inside the human heart, too.

#### The Egyptian Pantheon

These gods are a young dynasty of an ancient divine family, heirs to the
rulership of the cosmos and the

maintenance of the divine principle of Ma’at—the fundamental order of
truth, justice, law, and order that puts gods, mortal pharaohs, and
ordinary men and women in their logical and rightful place in the
universe.

The Egyptian pantheon is unusual in having three gods responsible for
death, each with different alignments. Anubis is the lawful neutral god
of the afterlife, who judges the souls of the dead. Set is a chaotic
evil god of murder, perhaps best known for killing his brother Osiris.
And Nephthys is a chaotic good goddess of mourning.

#### The Norse Pantheon

Where the land plummets from the snowy hills into the icy fjords below,
where the longboats draw up on to the beach, where the glaciers flow
forward and retreat with every fall and spring—this is the land of the
Vikings, the home of the Norse pantheon. It’s a brutal clime, and one
that calls for brutal living. The warriors of the land have had to adapt
to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven’t been too
twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of
raiding for food and wealth, it’s surprising the mortals turned out as
well as they did. Their powers reflect the need these warriors had for
strong leadership and decisive action. Thus, they see their deities in
every bend of a river, hear them in the crash of the thunder and the
booming of the glaciers, and smell them in the smoke of a burning
longhouse.

The Norse pantheon includes two main families, the Aesir (deities of war
and destiny) and the Vanir (gods of fertility and prosperity). Once
enemies, these two families are now closely allied against their common
enemies, the giants (including the gods Surtur and Thrym).

**Appendix C: The Planes of Existence** The cosmos teems with a
multitude of worlds as well as myriad alternate dimensions of reality,
called the **planes of existence**. It encompasses every world where GMs
run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the
Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter
and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and
angels, and the dominions of the gods.

Many spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon
the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and
allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater
power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or
test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with
each dawn.

The Material Plane
------------------

The Material Plane is the nexus where the philosophical and elemental
forces that define the other planes collide in the jumbled existence of
mortal life and mundane matter. All fantasy gaming worlds exist within
the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and
adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the
Material Plane.

The worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they
reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there,
as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include
magic-­‐‑wasted desert planets and island-­‐‑dotted water worlds, worlds
where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an
endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have
abandoned.

Beyond the Material
-------------------

Beyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of
myth and mystery. They’re not simply other worlds, but different
qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental
principles abstracted from the ordinary world.

### Planar Travel

When adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are
undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a
mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest. Such a
journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking
out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in
its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.

Travel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in
two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.

***Spells.*** A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to
other planes of existence. *Plane shift* and *gate* can transport
adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different
degrees of precision. *Etherealness* allows adventurers to enter the
Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it
touches—such as the Elemental Planes. And the *astral projection* spell
lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to
the Outer Planes.

***Portals.*** A portal is a general term for a stationary interplanar
connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific
location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a clear window, or
a fog-­‐‑ shrouded passage, and simply stepping through it effects the
interplanar travel. Others are locations— circles of standing stones,
soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns—that exist in
multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another in turn.
Some are vortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very
similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano
(leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane
of Water).

### Transitive Planes

The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive
Planes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as ways
to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as *etherealness* and
*astral projection* allow characters to enter these planes and traverse
them to reach the planes beyond.

> The **Ethereal Plane** is a misty, fog-­‐‑bound

dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores,
called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner
Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding
location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the
Border Ethereal, and the *see invisibility*

and *true seeing* spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also
extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly
effects that use force energy such as *forcecage* and *wall of force.*
The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling
mists and colorful fogs.

> The **Astral Plane** is the realm of thought and

dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of
the divine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and
below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of
light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color flicker in
midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid matter can be found
here, but most of the Astral Plane is an endless, open domain.

### Inner Planes

The Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its echoes,
providing the raw elemental substance from which all the worlds were
made. The four **Elemental Planes**—Air, Earth, Fire, and Water—form a
ring around the Material Plane, suspended within the churning
**Elemental Chaos**.

> At their innermost edges, where they are closest

to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical
sense), the four Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material
Plane. The four elements mingle together as they do in the Material
Plane, forming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane,
though, the Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the
elements exist in their purest form—great expanses of solid earth,
blazing fire, crystal-­‐‑clear water, and unsullied air. These regions
are little-­‐‑known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example,
a speaker usually means just the border region. At the farthest extents
of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed together into
an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding substance, the
Elemental Chaos.

### Outer Planes

If the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the
multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for
such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as
divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes
are best known as the homes of deities.

When discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be
highly metaphorical. Their

actual homes are not literally “places” at all, but exemplify the idea
that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the
Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer
Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie
beyond ordinary sensory experience.

Even in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive.
Initially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar to
natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at the whims
of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The desires of the
mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake them completely,
effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself to better fulfill
their own needs.

Distance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The
perceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they can
also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be possible to
take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first layer to the ninth,
in a single day—if the powers of the Hells desire it. Or it could take
weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.

The most well-­‐‑known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that
correspond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the shades
of distinction between them.

#### Outer Planes

The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the
**Upper Planes**. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in
the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the **Lower
Planes**. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A
plane’s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment
doesn’t match the plane’s experiences a profound sense of dissonance
there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good
Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature
feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.

#### Demiplanes

Demiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique
rules. They are pieces of reality that don’t seem to fit anywhere else.
Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by
spells, such as *demiplane,* or generated at the desire of a powerful
deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing
reality that

has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby
universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a
single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a *plane
shift* spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper
frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire. The
*gate* spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the
demiplane.

> **Traps**

Traps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb
might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor
and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance
might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among
the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy
game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or
fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.

A trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. **Mechanical
traps** include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-­‐‑filled
rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to
operate. **Magic traps** are either magical device traps or spell traps.
Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps
are spells such as *glyph of warding* and *symbol* that function as
traps.

### Traps in Play

When adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is
triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the
characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.

#### Triggering a Trap

Most traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches
something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers
include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor,
pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a
lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area
or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the *glyph of warding*
spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password
that prevents the trap from activating.

#### Detecting and Disabling a Trap

Usually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection.
Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure
plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in
the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect
something that points to a trap’s presence.

A trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it,
disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt
a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare
the DC to detect the trap with each

character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether
anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers
detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it,
either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an
Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs
to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to
perform the necessary sabotage.

Any character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or
disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s
description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In
addition, *dispel magic* has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A
magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when
you use *dispel magic*.

> In most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough

that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the
trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to
override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing
on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design
can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.

You should allow a character to discover a trap without making an
ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For
example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the
character has found the trigger and no check is required.

Foiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped
treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two
handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison
needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and
making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped.
Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and
push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the
trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the
shield.

> Traps are often designed with mechanisms that

allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place
traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without
harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable
their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes
around the trap.

> **Trap Effects**
>
> The effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use
> of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts
> of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements
> to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough
> to trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens when it
> is triggered.
>
> The attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its
>
> effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap’s
> severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the
> Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels
> of trap severity.
>
> A trap intended to be a **setback** is unlikely to kill
>
> or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a

#### Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses

  > **Trap Danger**   > **Save DC**   > **Attack Bonus**
  ------------------- --------------- --------------------
  > Setback           > 10–11         > +3 to +5
  > Dangerous         > 12–15         > +6 to +8
  > Deadly            > 16–20         > +9 to +12

> **Damage Severity by Level**

  > **Character Level**   > **Setback**   > **Dangerous**   > **Deadly**
  ----------------------- --------------- ----------------- --------------
  > 1st–4th               > 1d10          > 2d10            > 4d10
  > 5th–10th              > 2d10          > 4d10            > 10d10
  > 11th–16th             > 4d10          > 10d10           > 18d10
  > 17th–20th             > 10d10         > 18d10           > 24d10

> **Complex Traps**
>
> Complex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they
> execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the
> process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat
> encounter.
>
> When a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap’s
> description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap
> activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive
> attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or
> otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can
> be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.
>
> For example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a
> complex trap. On the trap’s turn, the water level rises. After several
> rounds, the room is completely flooded.

### Sample Traps

> The magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and
> are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Collapsing Roof

> *Mechanical trap*
>
> This trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an
> unstable section of a ceiling in place.
>
> The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two
> support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15
> Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trip wire
> harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check
> with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed
> check, the trap triggers.
>
> Anyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are
> merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a
> beam, causing the trap to trigger.
>
> The ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can
> see it can tell that it’s in danger of collapse.
>
> When the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling
>
> collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must
> succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10)
> bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
> successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is
> filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.

#### Falling Net

> *Mechanical trap*
>
> This trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the
> ceiling.
>
> The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two
> columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to
> spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check
> using thieves’ tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character
> without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using
> any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.
>
> When the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a
> 10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net
> and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are
> also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10

Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a
success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage
to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-­‐‑foot-­‐‑square section of it, freeing
any creature trapped in that section.

#### Fire-Breathing Statue

> *Magic trap*

This trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure
plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The
statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a
spell.

> The DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as

faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that
can sense the presence of magic, such as *detect magic*, reveals an aura
of evocation magic around the statue.

The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the
pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-­‐‑foot cone of fire.
Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.

Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents
the trap from activating. A successful *dispel magic* (DC 13) cast on
the statue destroys the trap.

#### Pits

> *Mechanical trap*

Four basic pit traps are presented here.

***Simple Pit.*** A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The
hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and
camouflaged with dirt and debris.

> The DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on

the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking
damage based on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are
deeper).

***Hidden Pit***. This pit has a cover constructed from material
identical to the floor around it.

A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot
traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A
successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to
confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a
pit.

When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor,
causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10
or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.

Once the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be
wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way
as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross.
The cover can also be magically held shut using the *arcane lock* spell
or similar magic.

***Locking Pit.*** This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with
one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is
spring-­‐‑loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps
shut to trap its victim inside.

A successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open.
The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also
attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be
reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually
hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.

***Spiked Pit.*** This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap
with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling
into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in
addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison
smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from
the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an
22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

#### Poison Darts

> *Mechanical trap*

When a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-­‐‑tipped darts
shoot from spring-­‐‑loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in
the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates,
each one rigged to its own set of darts.

The tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or
cleverly hidden amid bas-­‐‑reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the
walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the
pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create
it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron spike or other
object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.
Stuffing the holes with cloth or wax prevents the darts contained within
from launching.

The trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the
pressure plate, releasing four darts. Each dart makes a ranged attack
with a +8

bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate
(vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in
the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2
(1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

#### Poison Needle

> *Mechanical trap*

A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock, or in
something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the
proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.

When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out
from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11
(2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.

A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character
to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to
accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using
thieves’ tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock.
Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.

#### Rolling Sphere

> *Mechanical trap*

When 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap’s pressure
plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a
10-­‐‑foot-­‐‑diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.

With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot
the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a
successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations
in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate’s presence. The
same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the
stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other
object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.

Activation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll
initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it
moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures’
spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as
difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a
creature enters its

space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be
knocked prone.

The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go
around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving
turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.

As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow
it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere’s
speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops
moving and is no longer a threat.

#### Sphere of Annihilation

> *Magic trap*

Magical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face
carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly
circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of
it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated.

> A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth
> contains a *sphere of annihilation* that can’t be controlled or moved.
> It is otherwise identical to a normal *sphere of annihilation*.

Some versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone
face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to
approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like
the *sympathy* aspect of the *antipathy/sympathy* spell. A successful
*dispel magic* (DC 18) removes this enchantment.

Diseases
--------

A plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers on a quest to find
a cure. An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for
centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A
warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that
spreads whenever he casts spells.

> A simple outbreak might amount to little more

than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of *lesser
restoration*. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or
more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the
disease, and deal with the consequences.

A disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a
plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how
it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren’t bound
by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given
illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to
another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep
through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What
matters is the story you want to tell.

### Sample Diseases

The diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the
game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times,
symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your
campaign.

#### Cackle Fever

This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune.
While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits
of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid
nickname: “the shrieks.”

Symptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and
disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that
can’t be removed until the disease is cured.

Any event that causes the infected creature great stress—including
entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a
nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes
incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending

the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.

Any humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected
creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10
Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once
a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of
that particular infected creature for 24 hours.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13
Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save
and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When
the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease.
A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly
determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this
chapter.

#### Sewer Plague

Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that
incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are
sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as
rats and otyughs.

When a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the
disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated
by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving
throw or become infected.

It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague’s symptoms to manifest in an infected
creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature
suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal
number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from
finishing a long rest.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one
level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character’s exhaustion
level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the
infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers
from the disease.

#### Sight Rot

This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually
blinds the victim.

A beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after
infection, the creature’s vision starts to become blurry. The creature
takes a −1 penalty to attack

rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long
rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it
reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic
such as *lesser restoration* or *heal*.

Sight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows
in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an
herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to
the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from
worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the
disease entirely.

Madness
-------

In a typical campaign, characters aren’t driven mad by the horrors they
face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the
stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign
has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to
reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of
the threats the adventurers face.

### Going Mad

Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind.
Certain spells, such as *contact other plane* and *symbol*, can cause
insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell
effects of those spells*.* Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as
psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict
madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who
uses or becomes attuned to them.

> Resisting a madness-­‐‑inducing effect usually

requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.

### Madness Effects

Madness can be short-­‐‑term, long-­‐‑term, or indefinite. Most
relatively mundane effects impose short-­‐‑term madness, which lasts for
just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can
result in long-­‐‑term or indefinite madness.

> A character afflicted with **short-­‐‑term madness** is

subjected to an effect from the Short-­‐‑Term Madness table for 1d10
minutes.

> A character afflicted with **long-­‐‑term madness** is

subjected to an effect from the Long-­‐‑Term Madness table for 1d10 × 10
hours.

> A character afflicted with **indefinite madness**

gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts
until cured.

#### Short-­‐Term Madness

> **d100 Effect (lasts 1d10 minutes)**
>
> 01–20 The character retreats into his or her mind and becomes
> paralyzed. The effect ends if the character takes any damage.
>
> 21–30 The character becomes incapacitated and spends the duration
> screaming, laughing, or weeping.
>
> 31–40 The character becomes frightened and must
>
> use his or her action and movement each round to flee from the source
> of the fear.
>
> 41–50 The character begins babbling and is incapable of normal speech
> or spellcasting.
>
> 51–60 The character must use his or her action each round to attack
> the nearest creature.
>
> 61–70 The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has
> disadvantage on ability checks.
>
> 71–75 The character does whatever anyone tells him or her to do that
> isn’t obviously self-­‐ destructive.
>
> 76–80 The character experiences an overpowering
>
> urge to eat something strange such as dirt, slime, or offal.
>
> 81–90 The character is stunned. 91–100 The character falls
> unconscious.

#### Long-­‐Term Madness

> **d100 Effect (lasts 1d10 × 10 hours)**
>
> 01–10 The character feels compelled to repeat a specific activity over
> and over, such as washing hands, touching things, praying, or counting
> coins.
>
> 11–20 The character experiences vivid hallucinations and has
> disadvantage on ability checks.
>
> 21–30 The character suffers extreme paranoia. The character has
> disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks.
>
> 31–40 The character regards something (usually the
>
> source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the
> antipathy effect of the antipathy/sympathy spell.
>
> 41–45 The character experiences a powerful delusion.
>
> Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or she is under its
> effects.
>
> 46–55 The character becomes attached to a “lucky charm,” such as a
> person or an object, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability
> checks, and saving throws while more than 30 feet from it.
>
> 56–65 The character is blinded (25%) or deafened (75%).
>
> 66–75 The character experiences uncontrollable tremors or tics, which
> impose disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws
> that involve Strength or Dexterity.
>
> 76–85 The character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows
> who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but
> doesn’t recognize other people or remember anything that happened
> before the madness took effect.
>
> 86–90 Whenever the character takes damage, he or she must succeed on a
> DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as though he or she failed a
> saving throw against the confusion spell. The confusion effect lasts
> for 1 minute.
>
> 91–95 The character loses the ability to speak.
>
> 96–100 The character falls unconscious. No amount of jostling or
> damage can wake the character.

#### Indefinite Madness

> **d100 Flaw (lasts until cured)** 01–15 “Being drunk keeps me sane.”
> 16–25 “I keep whatever I find.”
>
> 26–30 “I try to become more like someone else I know—adopting his or
> her style of dress, mannerisms, and name.”
>
> 31–35 “I must bend the truth, exaggerate, or outright lie to be
> interesting to other people.”
>
> 36–45 “Achieving my goal is the only thing of interest to me, and I’ll
> ignore everything else to pursue it.”
>
> 46–50 “I find it hard to care about anything that goes on around me.”
>
> 51–55 “I don’t like the way people judge me all the time.”
>
> 56–70 “I am the smartest, wisest, strongest, fastest, and most
> beautiful person I know.”
>
> 71–80 “I am convinced that powerful enemies are hunting me, and their
> agents are everywhere I go. I am sure they’re watching me all the
> time.”
>
> 81–85 “There’s only one person I can trust. And only I can see this
> special friend.”
>
> 86–95 “I can’t take anything seriously. The more serious the
> situation, the funnier I find it.”
>
> 96–100 “I’ve discovered that I really like killing people.”

### Curing Madness

> A *calm emotions* spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a
> *lesser restoration* spell can rid a character of a short-­‐‑term or
> long-­‐‑term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, *remove
> curse* or *dispel evil* might also prove effective. A *greater
> restoration* spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a
> character of indefinite madness.

Objects
-------

> When characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash
> a vampire’s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough
> time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible
> object. Use common sense when determining a character’s success at
> damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone
> wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall
> does.
>
> For the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate
> item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a
> building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.

#### Statistics for Objects

> When time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to
> a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances,
> and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.
>
> ***Armor Class.*** An object’s Armor Class is a measure of how
> difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because
> the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor
> Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.
>
> **Object Armor Class Substance AC** Cloth, paper, rope 11
>
> Crystal, glass, ice 13
>
> Wood, bone 15
>
> Stone 17
>
> Iron, steel 19
>
> Mithral 21
>
> Adamantine 23
>
> ***Hit Points.*** An object’s hit points measure how much damage it
> can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects
> have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to
> have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of
> the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The
> Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and
> resilient objects that are Large or smaller.

#### Object Hit Points

> ***Huge and Gargantuan Objects.*** Normal weapons are of little use
> against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue,
> towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can
> burn a Huge tapestry, and an *earthquake* spell can reduce a colossus
> to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object’s hit points if
> you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand
> whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points
> for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track
> each section’s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections
> could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a
> human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit
> points.
>
> ***Objects and Damage Types.*** Objects are immune to poison and
> psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more
> effective against a particular object or substance than others. For
> example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for
> cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be
> vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone
> but can’t effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best
> judgment.
>
> ***Damage Threshold.*** Big objects such as castle walls often have
> extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a
> damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount
> of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its
> damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage
> that fails to meet or exceed the object’s damage threshold is
> considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the object’s hit points.

  > **Size**                                        > **Fragile**   > **Resilient**
  ------------------------------------------------- --------------- -----------------
  > Tiny (bottle, lock)                             > 2 (1d4)       > 5 (2d4)
  > Small (chest, lute)                             > 3 (1d6)       > 10 (3d6)
  > Medium (barrel, chandelier)                     > 4 (1d8)       > 18 (4d8)
  > Large (cart, 10-­‐ft.-­‐by-­‐10-­‐ft. window)   > 5 (1d10)      > 27 (5d10)

Poisons
-------

Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most
societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil
creatures.

> Poisons come in the following four types.

***Contact.*** Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains
potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches
contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

***Ingested.*** A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested
poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a
liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as
allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a
failed save.

***Inhaled.*** These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when
inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a
5-­‐‑foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately
afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons,
as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

***Injury.*** Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap
components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and
remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature
that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the
poison is exposed to its effects.

#### Poisons

> **Sample Poisons**

Each type of poison has its own debilitating effects.

***Assassin’s Blood (Ingested).*** A creature subjected to this poison
must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes
6 (1d12) poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful
save, the creature takes half damage and isn’t poisoned.

***Burnt Othur Fumes (Inhaled).*** A creature subjected to this poison
must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6)
poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of
its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes 3 (1d6)
poison damage. After three successful saves, the poison ends.

***Crawler Mucus (Contact).*** This poison must be harvested from a dead
or incapacitated crawler. A creature subjected to this poison must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1
minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.

***Drow Poison (Injury).*** This poison is typically made only by the
drow, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature
subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving
throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more,
the creature is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The
creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an
action to shake it awake.

> ***Essence of Ether (Inhaled).*** A creature subjected

to this poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or
become poisoned for 8 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The
creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an
action to shake it awake.

***Malice (Inhaled).*** A creature subjected to this poison must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The
poisoned creature is blinded.

***Midnight Tears (Ingested).*** A creature that ingests this poison
suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the poison has not
been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17
Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Oil of Taggit (Contact).*** A creature subjected to this poison must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24
hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it
takes damage.

***Pale Tincture (Ingested).*** A creature subjected to this poison must
succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison
damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving
throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save.
Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can’t be healed by
any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the
creature can heal normally.

> ***Purple Worm Poison (Injury).*** This poison must

be harvested from a dead or incapacitated purple worm. A creature
subjected to this poison must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw,
taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
on a successful one.

***Serpent Venom (Injury).*** This poison must be harvested from a dead
or incapacitated giant poisonous snake. A creature subjected to this
poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10
(3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

***Torpor (Ingested).*** A creature subjected to this poison must
succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 4d6
hours. The poisoned creature is incapacitated.

***Truth Serum (Ingested).*** A creature subjected to this poison must
succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1
hour. The poisoned creature can’t knowingly speak a lie, as if under the
effect of a *zone of truth* spell.

***Wyvern Poison (Injury).*** This poison must be harvested from a dead
or incapacitated wyvern. A creature subjected to this poison must make a
DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Magic Items
===========

Magic items are presented in alphabetical order. A magic item’s
description gives the item’s name, its category, its rarity, and its
magical properties.

#### Adamantine Armor

> *Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon*

This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest
substances in existence. While you’re wearing it, any critical hit
against you becomes a normal hit.

#### Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3

> *Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)*

You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of
magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the
ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.

#### Amulet of Health

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

Your Constitution score is 19 while you wear this amulet. It has no
effect on you if your Constitution is already 19 or higher.

#### Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this amulet, you are hidden from divination magic. You
can’t be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying
sensors.

#### Amulet of the Planes

> *Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that
you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15
Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the *plane shift*
spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of
you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1–60, you travel
to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61–100, you travel to
a randomly determined plane of existence.

#### Animated Shield

> *Armor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)*

While holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus
action to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers
in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your
hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a
bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die,
at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you
have one free.

#### Apparatus of the Crab

> *Wondrous item, legendary*

This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500
pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a
successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch
unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller
creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end,
each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain
levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.

The apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following
statistics:

###### Armor Class: 20

> **Hit Points:** 200
>
> **Speed:** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail
> aren’t extended)
>
> **Damage Immunities:** poison, psychic

To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the
apparatus’s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight.
The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by
the number of breathing creatures inside.

The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of
900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per
minute from pressure.

A creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two
of the apparatus’s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back
to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as
shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.

#### Apparatus of the Crab Levers

> **Lever Up Down**
>
> 1 Legs and tail extend, Legs and tail retract,
>
> tance to eoning, type or
>
> target. Hit: 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage.

6.  The apparatus walks or swims forward.

7.  The apparatus turns 90 degrees left.

8.  Eyelike fixtures emit

> bright light in a 30-­‐foot radius and dim light for an additional 30
> feet.

6.  The apparatus sinks as

> much as 20 feet in liquid.

6.  The rear hatch unseals and opens.

#### Armor, +1, +2, or +3

> target. Hit: The target is grappled (escape DC 15). The apparatus
> walks or swims backward.
>
> The apparatus turns 90 degrees right.
>
> The light turns off.
>
> The apparatus rises up to 20 feet in liquid.
>

#### Arrow-Catching Shield

> *Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)*
>
> You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this
> shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.
> In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a

>
> *Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (+1), very rare (+2), or
> legendary (+3)*
>
> You have a bonus to AC while wearing this armor. The bonus is
> determined by its rarity.

#### Armor of Invulnerability

> *Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)*
>
> You have resistance to nonmagical damage while you wear this armor.
> Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to
> nonmagical damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing

> until the next dawn.

#### Armor of Resistance

> *Armor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (requires attunement)*
>
> You have resistance to one type of damage while you wear this armor.
> The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options
> below.
>
> reaction to become the target of the attack instead.

#### Arrow of Slaying

> *Weapon (arrow), very rare*
>
> An *arrow of slaying* is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular
> kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example,
> there are both *arrows of dragon slaying* and *arrows of blue dragon
> slaying*. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group
> associated with an *arrow of slaying* takes damage from the arrow, the
> creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra
> 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on
> a successful one.
>
> Once an *arrow of slaying* deals its extra damage to
>
> a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.
>
> Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as *bolts of
> slaying* meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.

#### Bag of Beans

> *Wondrous item, rare*

Inside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs 1/2 pound
plus 1/4 pound for each bean it contains.

If you dump the bag’s contents out on the ground, they explode in a
10-­‐‑foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area,
including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The
fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or
carried.

If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then
water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground
where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following
table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.

> **d100 Effect**
>
> 01 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any
> die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
> saving throw or take 5d6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 hour.
> On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
>
> 02–10 A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea,
> vinegar, wine, or oil (GM’s choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12
> rounds.
>
> 11–20 A treant sprouts. There’s a 50 percent chance that the treant is
> chaotic evil and attacks.
>
> 21–30 An animate, immobile stone statue in your
>
> likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it
> and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains
> and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the
> same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The
> statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours.
>
> 31–40 A campfire with blue flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours
> (or until it is extinguished).
>
> 41–50 1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout
>
> 51–60 1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is
> touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the GM’s
> choice. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of
> bright pink smoke.
>
> 61–70 A hungry bulette burrows up and attacks. 71–80 A fruit tree
> grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of
>
> which act as randomly determined magic
>
> potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of the GM’s choice. The
> tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic
> for 30 days.
>
> 81–90 A nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any creature
>
> that eats an egg must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a
> successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability
> score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed
> save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical
> explosion.
>
> 91–99 A pyramid with a 60-­‐foot-­‐square base bursts upward. Inside
> is a sarcophagus containing a mummy lord. The pyramid is treated as
> the mummy lord’s lair, and its sarcophagus contains treasure of the
> GM’s choice.
>
> 00 A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the GM’s choice.
> The top leads where the GM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud
> giant’s castle, or a different plane of existence.

#### Bag of Devouring

> *Wondrous item, very rare*

This bag superficially resembles a *bag of holding* but is a feeding
orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside
out closes the orifice.

The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is
placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the
bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is
placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a
50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature
inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC
15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the
bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength
check (provided it isn’t pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that
starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.

Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot
of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects
inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM
determines the time and plane.

If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained
within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.

#### Bag of Holding

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside
dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The
bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet.
The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of

its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is
destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the
bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the
bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures
inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided
by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they
begin to suffocate.

Placing a *bag of holding* inside an extradimensional space created by a
*handy haversack*, *portable hole*, or similar item instantly destroys
both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10
feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral
Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-­‐‑way only and can’t be
reopened.

#### Bag of Tricks

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty.
Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy
object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.

> You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from

the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms
into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table
that corresponds to the bag’s color.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your
turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and
what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders,
such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the
creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.

Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can’t be
used again until the next dawn.

#### Bead of Force

> *Wondrous item, rare*

This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs
an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 *beads of force* are found together.

You can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes
on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-­‐‑foot radius of
where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or
take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the
area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely
within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded
on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the
center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable
air can pass through the sphere’s wall. No attack or other effect can.

An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s
wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s walking speed. The
sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound,
regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

#### Belt of Dwarvenkind

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits:

-   Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.

    > with dwarves.

> while wearing the belt:

-   You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have
    > resistance against poison damage.

-   You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.

-   You can speak, read, and write Dwarvish.

#### Belt of Giant Strength

> *Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)*
>
> While wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to a score
> granted by the belt. If your Strength is already equal to or greater
> than the belt’s score, the item has no effect on you.
>
> Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity
> according to the six kinds of true giants. The *belt of stone giant
> strength* and the *belt of frost giant strength* look different, but
> they have the same effect.

  > **Type**            > **Strength**   > **Rarity**

>
> You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
> weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your hit
> point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.
>
> ***Curse.*** This axe is cursed, and becoming attuned to
>
> it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are
> unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within reach at all times.
> You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than
> this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or
> hear.
>
> Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your
> possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go
> berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to
>
> attack the creature nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra
> attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks,
> moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current
> target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at
> random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures
> within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

#### Boots of Elvenkind

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*
>
> While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of
> the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on
> Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.

#### Boots of Levitation

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
>
> While you wear these boots, you can use an action to cast the
> *levitate* spell on yourself at will.

#### Boots of Speed

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
>
> While you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action and click the
> boots’ heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed,
> and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has
> disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together
> again, you end the effect.
>
> When the boots’ property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the
> magic ceases to function until you finish a long rest.

#### Boots of Striding and Springing

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
>
> While you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 30 feet, unless
> your walking speed is higher, and your speed isn’t reduced if you are
> encumbered or wearing heavy armor. In addition, you can jump three
> times the normal distance, though you can’t jump farther than your
> remaining movement would allow.

#### Boots of the Winterlands

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
>
> These furred boots are snug and feel quite warm. While you wear them,
> you gain the following benefits:

-   You have resistance to cold damage.

-   You ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow.

<!-- -->

-   You can tolerate temperatures as low as −50 degrees Fahrenheit
    > without any additional protection. If you wear heavy clothes, you
    > can tolerate temperatures as low as −100 degrees Fahrenheit.

#### Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals

> *Wondrous item, rare*

While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the
bowl’s command word and summon a water elemental, as if you had cast the
*conjure elemental* spell. The bowl can’t be used this way again until
the next dawn.

The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3
pounds and holds about 3 gallons.

#### Bracers of Archery

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing these bracers, you have proficiency with the longbow and
shortbow, and you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls on ranged attacks made
with such weapons.

#### Bracers of Defense

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing these bracers, you gain a +2 bonus to AC if you are
wearing no armor and using no shield.

#### Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals

> *Wondrous item, rare*

While a fire burns in this brass brazier, you can use an action to speak
the brazier’s command word and summon a fire elemental, as if you had
cast the *conjure elemental* spell. The brazier can’t be used this way
again until the next dawn.

> The brazier weighs 5 pounds.

#### Brooch of Shielding

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this brooch, you have resistance to force damage, and you
have immunity to damage from the *magic missile* spell.

#### Broom of Flying

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

This wooden broom, which weighs 3 pounds, functions like a mundane broom
until you stand astride it and speak its command word. It then hovers
beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50
feet. It can carry up to 400

pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200
pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.

You can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of
you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar
with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another
command word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.

#### Candle of Invocation

> *Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity’s
alignment. The candle’s alignment can be detected with the *detect evil
and good* spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or
determines the alignment randomly.

> **d20 Alignment**
>
> 1–2 Chaotic evil
>
> 3–4 Chaotic neutral
>
> 5–7 Chaotic good
>
> 8–9 Neutral evil
>
> 10–11 Neutral
>
> 12–13 Neutral good
>
> 14–15 Lawful evil
>
> 16–17 Lawful neutral
>
> 18–20 Lawful good

The candle’s magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires
an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can
snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in
increments of 1 minute from the candle’s total burn time.

> While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-­‐‑foot

radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of
the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with
advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment
matches the candle’s can cast 1st-­‐‑ level spells he or she has
prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell’s effect is as
if cast with a 1st-­‐‑level slot.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can
cast the *gate* spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.

#### Cape of the Mountebank

> *Wondrous item, rare*

This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it
to cast the *dimension door* spell as

an action. This property of the cape can’t be used again until the next
dawn.

When you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in
a similar cloud of smoke at your destination. The smoke lightly obscures
the space you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates at the
end of your next turn. A light or stronger wind disperses the smoke.

#### Carpet of Flying

> *Wondrous item, very rare*

You can speak the carpet’s command word as an action to make the carpet
hover and fly. It moves according to your spoken directions, provided
that you are within 30 feet of it.

Four sizes of *carpet of flying* exist. The GM chooses the size of a
given carpet or determines it randomly.

> **d100 Size Capacity Flying Speed**
>
> 01–20 3 ft. × 5 ft. 200 lb. 80 feet
>
> 21–55 4 ft. × 6 ft. 400 lb. 60 feet
>
> 56–80 5 ft. × 7 ft. 600 lb. 40 feet
>
> 81–100 6 ft. × 9 ft. 800 lb. 30 feet

A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but it
flies at half speed if it carries more than its normal capacity.

#### Censer of Controlling Air Elementals

> *Wondrous item, rare*

While incense is burning in this censer, you can use an action to speak
the censer’s command word and summon an air elemental, as if you had
cast the *conjure elemental* spell. The censer can’t be used this way
again until the next dawn.

> This 6-­‐‑inch-­‐‑wide, 1-­‐‑foot-­‐‑high vessel resembles a

chalice with a decorated lid. It weighs 1 pound.

#### Chime of Opening

> *Wondrous item, rare*

This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound.
You can strike it as an action, pointing it at an object within 120 feet
of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. The chime
issues a clear tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless
the sound can’t reach the object. If no locks or latches remain, the
object itself opens.

The chime can be used ten times. After the tenth time, it cracks and
becomes useless.

#### Circlet of Blasting

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the *scorching
ray* spell with it. When you make the spell’s attacks, you do so with an
attack bonus of

+5. The circlet can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.

#### Cloak of Arachnida

> *Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint silvery
threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:

-   You have resistance to poison damage.

-   You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

-   You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down
    > along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

-   You can’t be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as
    > if they were difficult terrain.

-   You can use an action to cast the *web* spell (save DC 13). The web
    > created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this
    > property of the cloak can’t be used again until the next dawn.

#### Cloak of Displacement

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

While you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear
to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any
creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take
damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next
turn. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated,
restrained, or otherwise unable to move.

#### Cloak of Elvenkind

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom (Perception) checks
made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks made to hide, as the cloak’s color shifts to camouflage
you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.

#### Cloak of Protection

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while you wear this cloak.

#### Cloak of the Bat

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
checks. In an area of dim light or darkness, you can grip the edges of
the cloak with both hands and use it to fly at a speed of 40 feet. If
you ever fail to grip the cloak’s edges while flying in this way, or if
you are no longer in dim light or darkness, you lose this flying speed.

> While wearing the cloak in an area of dim light or

darkness, you can use your action to cast *polymorph* on yourself,
transforming into a bat. While you are in the form of the bat, you
retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can’t
be used this way again until the next dawn.

#### Cloak of the Manta Ray

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

While wearing this cloak with its hood up, you can breathe underwater,
and you have a swimming speed of 60 feet. Pulling the hood up or down
requires an action.

#### Crystal Ball

> *Wondrous item, very rare or legendary (requires attunement)*

The typical *crystal ball*, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in
diameter. While touching it, you can cast the *scrying* spell (save DC
17) with it.

The following *crystal ball* variants are legendary items and have
additional properties.

> ***Crystal Ball of Mind Reading.*** You can use an action to cast the
> *detect thoughts* spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the
> *crystal ball*, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the
> spell’s sensor. You don’t need to concentrate on this *detect
> thoughts* to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying*
> ends.

***Crystal Ball of Telepathy.*** While scrying with the crystal ball,
you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30
feet of the spell’s sensor. You can also use an action to cast the
*suggestion* spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those
creatures. You don’t need to concentrate on this *suggestion* to
maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* ends. Once
used, the *suggestion* power of the *crystal ball* can’t be used again
until the next dawn.

> ***Crystal Ball of True Seeing.*** While scrying with

the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered
on the spell’s sensor.

#### Cube of Force

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on
it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains
1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.

You can use an action to press one of the cube’s faces, expending a
number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of
Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has
insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of
invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a
side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1
minute, until you use an action to press the cube’s sixth face, or the
cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier’s effect by
pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number
of charges, resetting the duration.

If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid
object that can’t pass through the cube, you can’t move any closer to
that object as long as the barrier remains.

#### Cube of Force Faces

  > **Face**   > **Charges**   > **Effect**
  ------------ --------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  > 1          > 1             > Gases, wind, and fog can’t pass through the barrier.
  > 2          > 2             > Nonliving matter can’t pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion.
  > 3          > 3             > Living matter can’t pass through the barrier.
  > 4          > 4             > Spell effects can’t pass through the barrier.
  > 5          > 5             > Nothing can pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion.
  > 6          > 0             > The barrier deactivates.

The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain spells or
comes into contact with certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in
the table below.

> **Spell or Item Charges Lost**
>
> *Disintegrate* 1d12 *Horn of blasting* 1d10 *Passwall* 1d6
>
> *Prismatic spray* 1d20
>
> *Wall of fire* 1d4

#### Cubic Gate

> *Wondrous item, legendary*

This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The
six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence,
one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes
determined by the GM.

You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the *gate*
spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side.
Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can
cast the *plane shift* spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport
the targets to the plane keyed to that side.

The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube
regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Dagger of Venom

> *Weapon (dagger), rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon.

You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade.
The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon
hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for 1
minute. The dagger can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.

#### Dancing Sword

> *Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*

You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and
speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies
up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of
it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage
rolls.

While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up
to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same
bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5
feet of it.

After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30
feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it
falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path
to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground.
It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away
from it.

#### Decanter of Endless Water

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The
decanter weighs 2 pounds.

You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three
command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your
choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start
of your next turn. Choose from the following options:

-   “Stream” produces 1 gallon of water.

-   “Fountain” produces 5 gallons of water.

-   “Geyser” produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser
    > 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the
    > decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within
    > 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving
    > throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a
    > creature, you can target an object that isn’t being worn or
    > carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is
    > either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.

#### Deck of Illusions

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A
deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 − 1 cards.

The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you
can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can
use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the
ground at a point within 30 feet of you.

An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and
remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the
appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that
it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory
creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically
anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the
illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass
through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature
identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.

The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled.
When the illusion ends, the

image on its card disappears, and that card can’t be used again.

#### Deck of Many Things

> *Wondrous item, legendary*

Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards
made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only
thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-­‐‑two.

> Before you draw a card, you must declare how

many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use
an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn
in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw
a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no
more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen
number, the remaining number of cards

fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.

Once a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the
Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible
to draw the same card twice.

***Balance.*** Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your
alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice
versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on
you.

***Comet.*** If you single-­‐‑handedly defeat the next hostile monster
or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to
gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.

***Donjon.*** You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended
animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and
carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared.
You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere.
You can’t be located by any divination magic, but a *wish* spell can
reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.

***Euryale.*** The card’s medusa-­‐‑like visage curses you. You take a
−2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the
magic of The Fates card can end this curse.

***The Fates.*** Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you
to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the
card’s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before
you die.

***Flames.*** A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your
ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to
slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.

help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain
by an avatar of death can’t be restored to life.

#### Avatar of Death

> *Medium undead, neutral evil*

###### Armor Class 20

> **Hit Points** half the hit point maximum of its summoner

**Speed** 60 ft., fly 60 ft. (hover)

> ***Fool.*** You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and

draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared
draws. If losing that much XP

###### STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA

> 16 (+3) 16 (+3) 16 (+3) 16 (+3) 16 (+3) 16 (+3)

would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an

amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.

***Gem.*** Twenty-­‐‑five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty
gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.

***Idiot.*** Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a
minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your
declared draws.

***Jester.*** You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards
beyond your declared draws.

> ***Key.*** A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you

are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.

***Knight.*** You gain the service of a 4th-­‐‑level fighter who appears
in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same
race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have
drawn him or her to you. You control this character.

> ***Moon.*** You are granted the ability to cast the *wish*

spell 1d3 times.

***Rogue.*** A nonplayer character of the GM’s choice becomes hostile
toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn’t known until the NPC or
someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a *wish* spell or divine
intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you.

***Ruin.*** All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic
items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses,
buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the
least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to
this card also disappears.

***Skull.*** You summon an avatar of death—a ghostly humanoid skeleton
clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears
in a space of the GM’s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you,
warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights
until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If
anyone tries to

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The avatar can move through other creatures
and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force
damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

> ***Turning Immunity.*** The avatar is immune to features that turn

>
> **Actions**

***Reaping Scythe.*** The avatar sweeps its spectral scythe through a
creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 7 (1d8 +

3\) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.

***Star.*** Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can
exceed 20 but can’t exceed 24.

***Sun.*** You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM
determines randomly) appears in your hands.

***Talons.*** Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates.
Artifacts in your possession aren’t destroyed but do vanish.

***Throne.*** You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you
double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In
addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the
world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which
you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.

***Vizier.*** At any time you choose within one year of drawing this
card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a
truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps
you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the
knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.

***The Void.*** This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from
your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM’s choice. One
or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in
this way, your body is incapacitated. A *wish* spell can’t restore your
soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it.
You draw no more cards.

#### Defender

> *Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon.

The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can
transfer some or all of the sword’s bonus to your Armor Class, instead
of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could
reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2
bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of
your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC
from it.

#### Demon Armor

> *Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can
understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor’s clawed gauntlets
turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal
slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a
damage die of 1d8.

***Curse.*** Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t doff it unless
you are targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic. While
wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons
and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.

#### Dimensional Shackles

> *Wondrous item, rare*

You can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated
creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size.
In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a

creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional
movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of
existence. They don’t prevent the creature from passing through an
interdimensional portal.

You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an
action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a
DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free
and destroys the shackles.

#### Dragon Scale Mail

> *Armor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement)*

Dragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes
dragons collect their cast-­‐‑off scales and gift them to humanoids.
Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead
dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage
on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of
dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined
by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).

Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically
discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles
of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can’t
be used again until the next dawn.

  > **Dragon**   > **Resistance**      > **Dragon**   > **Resistance**
  -------------- ------------------ -- -------------- ------------------
  > Black        > Acid                > Gold         > Fire
  > Blue         > Lightning           > Green        > Poison
  > Brass        > Fire                > Red          > Fire
  > Bronze       > Lightning           > Silver       > Cold
  > Copper       > Acid                > White        > Cold

#### Dragon Slayer

> *Weapon (any sword), rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon.

When you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 3d6
damage of the weapon’s type. For the purpose of this weapon, “dragon”
refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles
and wyverns.

#### Dust of Disappearance

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is
enough of it for one use. When

you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature
and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The
duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its
magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts
a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature.

#### Dust of Dryness

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an
action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of
water 15 feet on a side into one marble-­‐‑sized pellet, which floats or
rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is
negligible.

Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface,
causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed.
Doing so ends that pellet’s magic.

> An elemental composed mostly of water that is

exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving
throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

#### Dust of Sneezing and Choking

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It
appears to be *dust of disappearance*, and an *identify* spell reveals
it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you
and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must
succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to
breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way
is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on it on a success. The *lesser restoration* spell can also end
the effect on a creature.

#### Dwarven Plate

> *Armor (plate), very rare*

While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, if an
effect moves you against your will along the ground, you can use your
reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by up to 10 feet.

#### Dwarven Thrower

> *Weapon (warhammer), very rare (requires attunement by a dwarf)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon. It has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a
long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this
weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8
damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your
hand.

#### Efficient Quiver

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

Each of the quiver’s three compartments connects to an extradimensional
space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing
more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty
arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to
eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up
to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular
quiver or scabbard.

#### Efreeti Bottle

> *Wondrous item, very rare*

This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to
remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At
the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless
fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of
you.

The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what
happens.

> **d100 Effect**
>
> 01–10 The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the
> efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.
>
> 11–90 The efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you
>
> command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle, and a new stopper
> contains it. The stopper can’t be removed for 24 hours. The next two
> times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is
> opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the
> bottle loses its magic.
>
> 91–00 The efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for you. It
> disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the
> bottle loses its magic.

#### Elemental Gem

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

This gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to
break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the *conjure
elemental* spell, and the gem’s magic is lost. The type of gem
determines the elemental summoned by the spell.

> **Gem Summoned Elemental**
>
> Blue sapphire Air elemental
>
> Yellow diamond Earth elemental
>
> Red corundum Fire elemental
>
> Emerald Water elemental

#### Elven Chain

> *Armor (chain shirt), rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. You are considered
proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with medium
armor.

#### Eversmoking Bottle

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

Smoke leaks from the lead-­‐‑stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which
weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of
thick smoke pours out in a 60-­‐‑foot radius from the bottle. The
cloud’s area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open
and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches
its maximum radius of 120 feet.

The cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle
requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is
closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20
miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong
wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.

#### Eyes of Charming

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While
wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the *charm
person* spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided
that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all
expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Eyes of Minute Seeing

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you can see
much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on
Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching
an area or studying an object within that range.

#### Eyes of the Eagle

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have
advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In
conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even
extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.

#### Feather Token

> *Wondrous item, rare*

This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens
exist, each with a different single-­‐‑ use effect. The GM chooses the
kind of token or determines it randomly.

> **d100 Feather Token d100 Feather Token**
>
> 01–20 Anchor 51–65 Swan boat
>
> 21–35 Bird 66–90 Tree
>
> 36–50 Fan 91–00 Whip

***Anchor.*** You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or
ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means.
Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect
ends, the token disappears.

***Bird.*** You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air.
The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place.
The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands
and can’t attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its
maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with
a one-­‐‑hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half
that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a
day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an
action.

***Fan.*** If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss
the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant
flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong
enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its

speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an
action.

***Swan Boat.*** You can use an action to touch the token to a body of
water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a
50-­‐‑foot-­‐‑long, 20-­‐‑foot-­‐‑ wide boat shaped like a swan takes
its place. The boat is self-­‐‑propelled and moves across water at a
speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to
command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to
thirty-­‐‑two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as
four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat
remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an
action.

***Tree.*** You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an
action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token
disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into
existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-­‐‑foot-­‐‑diameter
trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-­‐‑foot radius.

> ***Whip.*** You can use an action to throw the token to

reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops
to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again
while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its
property can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed,
as specified in the figurine’s description.

***Bronze Griffon (Rare).*** This bronze statuette is of a griffon
rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been
used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed.

***Ebony Fly (Rare).*** This ebony statuette is carved in the likeness
of a horsefly. It can become a giant fly for up to 12 hours and can be
ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 2
days have passed.

#### Giant Fly

a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears,

and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to
make a melee spell attack against a

###### STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA

14 (+2) 13 (+1) 13 (+1) 2 (−4) 10 (+0) 3 (−4)

creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack

bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20
feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The
whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or
when you are incapacitated or die.

#### Figurine of Wondrous Power

> *Wondrous item, rarity by figurine*

A *figurine of wondrous power* is a statuette of a beast small enough to
fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and
throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the
figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature
would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there
isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a
creature.

> The creature is friendly to you and your

companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken
commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but
takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end
of the duration, the creature

> **Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 10

###### Languages —

***Golden Lions (Rare).*** These gold statuettes of lions are always
created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each
can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can’t
be used again until 7 days have passed.

***Ivory Goats (Rare).*** These ivory statuettes of goats are always
created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions
differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:

-   The *goat of traveling* can become a Large goat with the same
    > statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or
    > portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it

***Marble Elephant (Rare).*** This marble statuette is about 4 inches
high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has
been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.

***Obsidian Steed (Very Rare).*** This polished obsidian horse can
become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to
defend itself. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 5
days have passed.

If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each
time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to
figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your
orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random
location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine
form.

> ***Onyx Dog (Rare).*** This onyx statuette of a dog can

become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8
and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet
and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it
has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.

> ***Serpentine Owl (Rare).*** This serpentine statuette

of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been
used, it can’t be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can
telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on
the same plane of existence.

***Silver Raven (Uncommon).*** This silver statuette of a raven can
become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be
used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine
allows you to cast the *animal messenger* spell on it at will.

#### Flame Tongue

> *Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)*

You can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword’s command word,
causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light
in a 40-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While
the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it
hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command
word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

#### Folding Boat

> *Wondrous item, rare*

This object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6
inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be
opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words,
each requiring you to use an action to speak it.

> One command word causes the box to unfold into

a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair
of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to
four Medium creatures comfortably.

The second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet
long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats,
five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast
with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures
comfortably.

When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal
vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the
boat.

The third command word causes the *folding boat* to fold back into a
box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel
that can’t fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any
objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.

#### Frost Brand

> *Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*

When you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an
extra 1d6 cold damage. In addition, while you hold the sword, you have
resistance to fire damage.

In freezing temperatures, the blade sheds bright light in a 10-­‐‑foot
radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

When you draw this weapon, you can extinguish all nonmagical flames
within 30 feet of you. This property can be used no more than once per
hour.

#### Gauntlets of Ogre Power

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

Your Strength score is 19 while you wear these gauntlets. They have no
effect on you if your Strength is already 19 or higher.

#### Gem of Brightness

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an
action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following
effects:

-   The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a
    > 30-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This
    > effect doesn’t expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus
    > action to repeat the command word or until you use another
    > function of the gem.

-   The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire
    > a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60
    > feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
    > saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can
    > repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
    > the effect on itself on a success.

-   The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare
    > with blinding light in a 30-­‐‑ foot cone originating from it.
    > Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by
    > the beam created with the second command word.

When all of the gem’s charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical
jewel worth 50 gp.

#### Gem of Seeing

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This gem has 3 charges. As an action, you can speak the gem’s command
word and expend 1 charge. For the next 10 minutes, you have truesight
out to 120 feet when you peer through the gem.

The gem regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Giant Slayer

> *Weapon (any axe or sword), rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon.

> When you hit a giant with it, the giant takes an

extra 2d6 damage of the weapon’s type and must succeed on a DC 15
Strength saving throw or fall

prone. For the purpose of this weapon, “giant” refers to any creature
with the giant type, including ettins and trolls.

#### Glamoured Studded Leather

> *Armor (studded leather), rare*

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can also use a
bonus action to speak the armor’s command word and cause the armor to
assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of
armor. You decide what it looks like, including color, style, and
accessories, but the armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The
illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove
the armor.

#### Gloves of Missile Snaring

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When
a ranged weapon attack hits you while you’re wearing them, you can use
your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier,
provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you
can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that
hand.

#### Gloves of Swimming and Climbing

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming don’t cost you extra
movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to
climb or swim.

#### Goggles of Night

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

While wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of
60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases
its range by 60 feet.

#### Hammer of Thunderbolts

> *Weapon (maul), legendary*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon.

> ***Giant’s Bane (Requires Attunement).*** You must

be wearing a *belt of giant strength* (any variety) and *gauntlets of
ogre power* to attune to this weapon. The attunement ends if you take
off either of those items. While you are attuned to this weapon and
holding it, your Strength score increases by 4 and can exceed

20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this
weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw or die.

> The hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to

it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the
hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range
of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer
unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every
creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. The hammer
regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Handy Haversack

> *Wondrous item, rare*

This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is
an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of
material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central
pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack
always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.

Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for
interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires
you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific
item, the item is always magically on top.

The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp
object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed.
If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although
an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned
inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must
be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is
placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10
minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a *bag
of holding*, *portable hole*, or similar item instantly destroys both
items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where
the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of
the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the
Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-­‐‑way only and
can’t be reopened.

#### Hat of Disguise

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the *disguise
self* spell from it at will. The spell ends if the hat is removed.

#### Headband of Intellect

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

Your Intelligence score is 19 while you wear this headband. It has no
effect on you if your Intelligence is already 19 or higher.

#### Helm of Brilliance

> *Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire
opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust.
When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.

> You gain the following benefits while wearing it:

-   You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC
    > 18), using one of the helm’s gems of the specified type as a
    > component: *daylight* (opal), *fireball* (fire opal), *prismatic
    > spray* (diamond), or *wall of fire* (ruby). The gem is destroyed
    > when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.

-   As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in
    > a 30-­‐‑foot radius when at least one undead is within that area.
    > Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6
    > radiant damage.

-   As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to
    > fire damage.

-   As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an
    > action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are
    > holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a
    > 10-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The
    > flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an
    > attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6
    > fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak
    > the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.

Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result
of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm
emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60
feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving
throw or be

struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in
the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.

#### Helm of Comprehending Languages

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*
>
> While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the *comprehend
> languages* spell from it at will.

#### Helm of Telepathy

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the *detect
thoughts* spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain
concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a
telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using
a bonus action to do so—while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with *detect thoughts*, you can use an
action to cast the *suggestion* spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that
creature. Once used, the *suggestion* property can’t be used again until
the next dawn.

#### Helm of Teleportation

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes
5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a
creature takes half as much damage and isn’t deafened. Creatures and
objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw
and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.

Each use of the horn’s magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn
to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and
destroys the horn.

#### Horn of Valhalla

> *Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or
> legendary (iron)*

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits
from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics
of a berserker*.* They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop
to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can’t be used again until 7
days have passed.

Four types of *horn of Valhalla* are known to exist, each made of a
different metal. The horn’s type determines how many berserkers answer
its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the
horn’s type or determines it randomly.

This helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can

use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the

> **d100 Horn Type**
>
> **Berserkers Summoned**
>
> **Requirement**
>
> *teleport* spell from it. The helm regains 1d3

expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Holy Avenger

> *Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement by a paladin)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon. When you hit a fiend or an undead with it, that creature takes
an extra 2d10 radiant damage.

While you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a 10-­‐‑foot
radius around you. You and all creatures friendly to you in the aura
have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical
effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius
of the aura increases to 30 feet.

#### Horn of Blasting

> *Wondrous item, rare*

You can use an action to speak the horn’s command word and then blow the
horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-­‐‑foot cone that is
audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make

> 01–40 Silver 2d4 + 2 None
>
> 41–75 Brass 3d4 + 3 Proficiency with all
>
> simple weapons 76–90 Bronze 4d4 + 4 Proficiency with all
>
> medium armor 91–00 Iron 5d4 + 5 Proficiency with all
>
> martial weapons

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned
berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to
you and your companions and follow your commands.

#### Horseshoes of a Zephyr

> *Wondrous item, very rare*

These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are
affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the
creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This
effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable
surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and
ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move

at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion
from a forced march.

#### Horseshoes of Speed

> *Wondrous item, rare*

These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are
affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the
creature’s walking speed by 30 feet.

#### Immovable Rod

> *Rod, uncommon*

This flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to
press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in
place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button
again, the rod doesn’t move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can
hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to
deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30
Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.

#### Instant Fortress

> *Wondrous item, rare*

You can use an action to place this 1-­‐‑inch metal cube on the ground
and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that
remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses
it, which works only if the fortress is empty.

The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with
arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is
divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect
them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated,
the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only
at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to
the *knock* spell and similar magic, such as that of a *chime of
opening*.

Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the
creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the
fortress. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take
this damage and are pushed automatically.

The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being
tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points,

immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and
resistance to all other damage. Only a *wish* spell can repair the
fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th
level or lower). Each casting of *wish* causes the roof, the door, or
one wall to regain 50 hit points.

#### Ioun Stone

> *Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)*

An *Ioun stone* is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy
revered on some worlds. Many types of *Ioun stone* exist, each type a
distinct combination of shape and color.

> When you use an action to toss one of these stones

into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and
confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an
action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by
making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow
the stone, ending its effect.

A stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is
considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.

***Absorption (Very Rare).*** While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits
your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or
lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.

Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns
dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level
is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone
can’t cancel it.

> ***Agility (Very Rare).*** Your Dexterity score

increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits
your head.

> ***Awareness (Rare).*** You can’t be surprised while this dark blue
> rhomboid orbits your head.

***Fortitude (Very Rare).*** Your Constitution score increases by 2, to
a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.

***Greater Absorption (Legendary).*** While this marbled lavender and
green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a
spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting
only you.

> Once the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it

burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by
a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone
has left, the stone can’t cancel it.

***Insight (Very Rare).*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a
maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.

***Intellect (Very Rare).*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to
a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your
head.

***Leadership (Very Rare).*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a
maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your
head.

> ***Mastery (Legendary).*** Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while
> this pale green prism orbits your head.
>
> ***Protection (Rare).*** You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty
> rose prism orbits your head.

***Regeneration (Legendary).*** You regain 15 hit points at the end of
each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you
have at least 1 hit point.

***Reserve (Rare).*** This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into
it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels
worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 − 1 levels of
stored spells chosen by the GM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by
touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to
be stored in the stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is
expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell
determines how much space it uses.

While this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it.
The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and
spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as
if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored
in it, freeing up space.

***Strength (Very Rare).*** Your Strength score increases by 2, to a
maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.

> ***Sustenance (Rare).*** You don’t need to eat or drink while this
> clear spindle orbits your head.

#### Iron Bands of Binding

> *Wondrous item, rare*

This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound.
You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at
a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the
sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.

Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity
modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained
until you take a bonus action to speak the command

word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes
the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC
20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is
destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any
further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours
have elapsed.

Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again until the next dawn.

#### Iron Flask

> *Wondrous item, legendary*

This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the
flask’s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60
feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than
the one you’re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving
throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the
flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a
creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only
one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t need to
breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.

You can use an action to remove the flask’s stopper and release the
creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your
companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you
give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its
death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of
the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal
disposition and alignment.

An *identify* spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the
only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly
discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or
determined randomly.

#### Javelin of Lightning

> *Weapon (javelin), uncommon*

This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command
word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide
that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in
the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much
damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin
when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the
target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6
lightning damage.

The javelin’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn. In the
meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.

#### Lantern of Revealing

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil,
shedding bright light in a 30-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an
additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long
as they are in the lantern’s bright light. You can use an action to
lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-­‐‑ foot radius.

#### Luck Blade

> *Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon. While the sword is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to
saving throws.

***Luck.*** If the sword is on your person, you can call on its luck (no
action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving
throw you dislike. You must use the second roll. This property can’t be
used again until the next dawn.

***Wish.*** The sword has 1d4 – 1 charges. While holding it, you can use
an action to expend 1 charge

and cast the *wish* spell from it. This property can’t be used again
until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.

#### Mace of Disruption

> *Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)*

When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature
takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or
fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving
throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes
frightened of you until the end of your next turn.

> While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in

a 20-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

#### Mace of Smiting

> *Weapon (mace), rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the mace to attack a
construct.

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target
takes an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage if it’s
a construct. If a construct has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this
damage, it is destroyed.

#### Mace of Terror

> *Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)*

This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action
and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your
choice in a 30-­‐‑foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15
Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it
is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to
move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a
space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its
action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect
that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the
creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a
creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a
success.

The mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Mantle of Spell Resistance

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*
>
> You have advantage on saving throws against spells while you wear this
> cloak.

#### Manual of Bodily Health

> *Wondrous item, very rare*
>
> This book contains health and diet tips, and its words are charged
> with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer
> studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your
> Constitution score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that
> score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.

#### Manual of Gainful Exercise

> *Wondrous item, very rare*
>
> This book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with
> magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying

> loses its magic, but regains it in a century.

#### Manual of Golems

> *Wondrous item, very rare*
>
> This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a
> particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it
> randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster
> with at least two 5th-­‐‑level spell slots. A creature that can’t use
> a *manual of golems* and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.

  > **d20**   > **Golem**   > **Time**   > **Cost**
  ----------- ------------- ------------ --------------
  > 1–5       > Clay        > 30 days    > 65,000 gp
  > 6–17      > Flesh       > 60 days    > 50,000 gp

  > 19–20     > Stone       > 90 days    > 80,000 gp

> To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working
> without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than
> 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase
> supplies.
>
> Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch
> flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are

#### Manual of Quickness of Action

> *Wondrous item, very rare*
>
> This book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words
> are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days
> or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines,

> score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.

#### Marvelous Pigments

> *Wondrous item, very rare*
>
> Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush
> (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create
> three-­‐‑dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The
> paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you
> concentrate on its image.
>
> Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a
> surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain
> features—such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or
> weapons— that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to
> cover 100 square feet.
>
> When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted
> becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall
> creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond.
> Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts
> against the total area of objects you create.
>
> Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp.
> If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile
> of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it
> is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.
>
> If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy
> appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no
> harm to anything.

#### Medallion of Thoughts

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*
>
> The medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action
> and expend 1 charge to cast the *detect thoughts* spell (save DC 13)
> from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Mirror of Life Trapping

> *Wondrous item, very rare*

When this 4-­‐‑foot-­‐‑tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface
shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has
AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It
shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.

If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet
of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it.
It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word
again.

Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated
mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma
saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or
carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. This
saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror’s
nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.

An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog
that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s
cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature
trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel.
Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.

If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are
already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to
accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied
space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror
is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in
unoccupied spaces near it.

While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the
name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by
number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an
image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate
normally.

> In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a

second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The
freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied
space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.

#### Mithral Armor

> *Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon*

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate
can be worn under normal clothes. If

the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or
has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t.

#### Necklace of Adaptation

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any
environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against
harmful gases and vapors (such as *cloudkill* and *stinking cloud*
effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).

#### Necklace of Fireballs

> *Wondrous item, rare*

This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action
to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the
end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-­‐‑level *fireball*
spell (save DC 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action.
When you do so, increase the level of the *fireball* by 1 for each bead
beyond the first.

#### Necklace of Prayer Beads

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or
> paladin)*

This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl,
or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as
amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic
bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.

Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on
the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than
one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace.
Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action
(using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead’s
spell is cast, that bead can’t be used again until the next dawn.

  > **d20**   > **Bead of …**   > **Spell**
  ----------- ----------------- -------------
  > 1–6       > Blessing        > *Bless*

> 7–12 Curing *Cure wounds* (2nd level) or *lesser*

> 17–18 Smiting *Branding smite*

20. Wind *Wind walk*

#### Nine Lives Stealer

> *Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon.

> The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a

critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly
as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an
undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain.
When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.

#### Oathbow

> *Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)*

When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, “Swift defeat
to my enemies.” When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you
can, as a command phrase, say, “Swift death to you who have wronged me.”
The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or
until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a
time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the
next dawn.

When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn
enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no
benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no
disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy
takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.

While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with
all other weapons.

#### Oil of Etherealness

> *Potion, rare*

Beads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and
quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along
with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is
required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10
minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the
*etherealness* spell for 1 hour.

#### Oil of Sharpness

> *Potion, very rare*

This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin silver shards.
The oil can coat one slashing or

piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition.
Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical
and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

#### Oil of Slipperiness

> *Potion, uncommon*

This sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it
flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller
creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one
additional vial is required for each size category above Medium).
Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the
effect of a *freedom of movement* spell for 8 hours.

Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where
it covers a 10-­‐‑foot square, duplicating the effect of the *grease*
spell in that area for 8 hours.

#### Pearl of Power

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its
command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot
was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you

use the pearl, it can’t be used again until the next

dawn.

#### Periapt of Health

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

You are immune to contracting any disease while you wear this pendant.
If you are already infected with a disease, the effects of the disease
are suppressed you while you wear the pendant.

#### Periapt of Proof against Poison

> *Wondrous item, rare*

This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-­‐‑cut black gem pendant.
While you wear it, poisons have no effect on you. You are immune to the
poisoned condition and have immunity to poison damage.

#### Periapt of Wound Closure

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the
start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain
hit points, double the number of hit points it restores.

#### Philter of Love

> *Potion, uncommon*

The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this
philter, you become charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature
is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it
as your true love while you are charmed. This potion’s rose-­‐‑hued,
effervescent liquid contains one easy-­‐‑to-­‐‑miss bubble shaped like a
heart.

#### Pipes of Haunting

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They
have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge
to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of
you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the
area that aren’t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving
throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A
creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of
these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at
dawn.

#### Pipes of the Sewers

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While
you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are
indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or
harm them.

The pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can
use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of
rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within
half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the
GM). If there aren’t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted.
Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but
aren’t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended
charges daily at dawn.

Whenever a swarm of rats that isn’t under another creature’s control
comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can
make a Charisma check contested by the swarm’s Wisdom check. If you lose
the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed
by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest,

the swarm is swayed by the pipes’ music and becomes friendly to you and
your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round
as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no
commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no
actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can’t hear the pipes’
music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it
normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24
hours.

#### Plate Armor of Etherealness

> *Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)*

While you’re wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an
action to gain the effect of the *etherealness* spell, which last for 10
minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the
command word again. This property of the armor can’t be used again until
the next dawn.

#### Portable Hole

> *Wondrous item, rare*

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a
handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold a *portable hole* and place it on or
against a solid surface, whereupon the *portable hole* creates an
extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the
hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open
passages. Any creature inside an open *portable hole* can exit the hole
by climbing out of it.

You can use an action to close a *portable hole* by taking hold of the
edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole,
and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional
space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.

If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional
space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful
check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the
*portable hole* or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within
a closed *portable hole* can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which
time it begins to suffocate.

Placing a *portable hole* inside an extradimensional space created by a
*bag of holding*, *handy haversack*, or similar item instantly destroys
both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10
feet of the gate is sucked through

it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then
closes. The gate is one-­‐‑way only and can’t be reopened.

#### Potion of Animal Friendship

> *Potion, uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you can cast the *animal friendship* spell
(save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings
little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw,
or a squirrel hair.

#### Potion of Clairvoyance

> *Potion, rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the *clairvoyance*
spell. An eyeball bobs in this yellowish liquid but vanishes when the
potion is opened.

#### Potion of Climbing

> *Potion, common*

When you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your
walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on
Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated
into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking
the bottle fails to mix the colors.

#### Potion of Diminution

> *Potion, rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the
*enlarge/reduce* spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The
red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and
then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle
fails to interrupt this process.

#### Potion of Flying

> *Potion, very rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your
walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you’re in the air when the
potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying
aloft. This potion’s clear liquid floats at the top of its container and
has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.

#### Potion of Gaseous Form

> *Potion, rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the *gaseous form*
spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect
as a bonus action. This potion’s container seems to hold fog that moves
and pours like water.

#### Potion of Giant Strength

> *Potion, rarity varies*

When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The
type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has
no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that
score.

> This potion’s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of
> fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The *potion of frost
> giant strength* and the *potion of stone giant strength* have the same
> effect.
>
> **Type of Giant Strength Rarity** Hill giant 21 Uncommon Frost/stone
> giant 23 Rare
>
> Fire giant 25 Rare
>
> Cloud giant 27 Very rare
>
> Storm giant 29 Legendary

#### Potion of Growth

> *Potion, uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the
*enlarge/reduce* spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The
red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to
color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle
fails to interrupt this process.

#### Potion of Healing

> *Potion, rarity varies*

You regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit
points depends on the potion’s rarity, as shown in the Potions of
Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion’s red liquid glimmers
when agitated.

#### Potions of Healing

> **Potion of … Rarity HP Regained** Healing Common 2d4 + 2 Greater
> healing Uncommon 4d4 + 4 Superior healing Rare 8d4 + 8 Supreme healing
> Very rare 10d4 + 20

#### Potion of Heroism

> *Potion, rare*

For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last
for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the
*bless* spell (no concentration required). This blue potion bubbles and
steams as if boiling.

#### Potion of Invisibility

> *Potion, very rare*

This potion’s container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid.
When you drink it, you become invisible for 1 hour. Anything you wear or
carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast
a spell.

#### Potion of Mind Reading

> *Potion, rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the *detect thoughts*
spell (save DC 13). The potion’s dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud
of pink floating in it.

#### Potion of Poison

> *Potion, uncommon*

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a *potion of healing* or
other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by
illusion magic. An *identify* spell reveals its true nature.

If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a
DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of
your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison
damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving
throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your
subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage
decreases to 0.

#### Potion of Resistance

> *Potion, uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you gain resistance to one type of damage
for 1 hour. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the
options below.

> **d10 Damage Type d10 Damage Type**

1.  Acid 6 Necrotic

2.  Cold 7 Poison

3.  Fire 8 Psychic

4.  Force 9 Radiant

5.  Lightning 10 Thunder

#### Potion of Speed

> *Potion, very rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the *haste* spell for
1 minute (no concentration required). The potion’s yellow fluid is
streaked with black and swirls on its own.

#### Potion of Water Breathing

> *Potion, uncommon*

You can breathe underwater for 1 hour after drinking this potion. Its
cloudy green fluid smells of the sea and has a jellyfish-­‐‑like bubble
floating in it.

#### Restorative Ointment

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4 + 1 doses of a thick
mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2
pound.

As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to
the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points,
ceases to be poisoned, and is cured of any disease.

#### Ring of Animal Influence

> *Ring, rare*

This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at
dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its
charges to cast one of the following spells:

-   *Animal friendship* (save DC 13)

-   *Fear* (save DC 13), targeting only beasts that have an Intelligence
    > of 3 or lower

-   *Speak with animals*

#### Ring of Djinni Summoning

> *Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can speak its command word as an action to
summon a particular djinni from the Elemental Plane of Air. The djinni
appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It
remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to
a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns
to its home plane.

While summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and your companions. It
obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you
fail to

command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no
other actions.

After the djinni departs, it can’t be summoned again for 24 hours, and
the ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies.

#### Ring of Elemental Command

> *Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*

This ring is linked to one of the four Elemental Planes. The GM chooses
or randomly determines the linked plane.

While wearing this ring, you have advantage on attack rolls against
elementals from the linked plane, and they have disadvantage on attack
rolls against you. In addition, you have access to properties based on
the linked plane.

The ring has 5 charges. It regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at
dawn. Spells cast from the ring have a save DC of 17.

***Ring of Air Elemental Command.*** You can expend 2 of the ring’s
charges to cast *dominate monster* on an air elemental. In addition,
when you fall, you descend 60 feet per round and take no damage from
falling. You can also speak and understand Auran.

If you help slay an air elemental while attuned to the ring, you gain
access to the following additional properties:

-   You have resistance to lightning damage.

-   You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover.

-   You can cast the following spells from the ring, expending the
    > necessary number of charges: *chain lightning* (3 charges), *gust

    > *fireball* (2 charges), and *wall of fire* (3 charges).

> ***Ring of Water Elemental Command.*** You can expend 2 of the ring’s

#### Ring of Evasion

> *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at
dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing it, you can
use your reaction to expend 1 of its charges to succeed on that saving
throw instead.

#### Ring of Feather Falling

> *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

When you fall while wearing this ring, you descend 60 feet per round and
take no damage from falling.

#### Ring of Free Action

> *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

While you wear this ring, difficult terrain doesn’t cost you extra
movement. In addition, magic can

neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be paralyzed or restrained.

#### Ring of Invisibility

> *Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can turn invisible as an action. Anything
you are wearing or carrying is invisible with you. You remain invisible
until the ring is removed, until you attack or cast a spell, or until
you use a bonus action to become visible again.

#### Ring of Jumping

> *Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can cast the *jump* spell from it as a
bonus action at will, but can target only yourself when you do so.

#### Ring of Mind Shielding

> *Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows other
creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you are lying, know
your alignment, or know your creature type. Creatures can telepathically
communicate with you only if you allow it.

You can use an action to cause the ring to become invisible until you
use another action to make it visible, until you remove the ring, or
until you die.

If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters it, unless it
already houses a soul. You can remain in the ring or depart for the
afterlife. As long as your soul is in the ring, you can telepathically
communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can’t prevent this
telepathic communication.

#### Ring of Protection

> *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while wearing this ring.

#### Ring of Regeneration

> *Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you regain 1d6 hit points every 10 minutes,
provided that you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part,
the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full
functionality after 1d6 + 1 days if you have at least 1 hit point the
whole time.

#### Ring of Resistance

> *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

You have resistance to one damage type while wearing this ring. The gem
in the ring indicates the type, which the GM chooses or determines
randomly.

  > **d10**   > **Damage Type**   > **Gem**
  ----------- ------------------- --------------
  > 1         > Acid              > Pearl
  > 2         > Cold              > Tourmaline

  > 10        > Thunder           > Spinel

#### Ring of Shooting Stars

> *Ring, very rare (requires attunement outdoors at night)*

While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast *dancing
lights* and *light* from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the
ring requires an action.

The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring
regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

> ***Faerie Fire.*** You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast
> *faerie fire* from the ring.

***Ball Lightning.*** You can expend 2 charges as an action to create
one to four 3-­‐‑foot-­‐‑diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres
you create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.

Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet
of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating
on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-­‐‑foot
radius.

As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no
farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you
comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that
creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage
based on the number of spheres you created.

> **Spheres Lightning Damage**
>
> 4 2d4
>
> 3 2d6
>
> 2 5d4
>
> 1 4d12

***Shooting Stars.*** You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For
every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the
ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within
a 15-­‐‑foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and
must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Ring of Spell Storing

> *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned
wearer uses them. The ring can store up to 5 levels worth of spells at a
time. When found, it contains 1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by
the GM.

Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by
touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other
than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can’t hold the spell, the
spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the
spell determines how much space it uses.

While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell
uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting
ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast
the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it,
freeing up space.

#### Ring of Spell Turning

> *Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving throws against any
spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if
you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the
spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the
slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the
caster.

#### Ring of Swimming

> *Ring, uncommon*

You have a swimming speed of 40 feet while wearing this ring.

#### Ring of Telekinesis

> *Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can cast the *telekinesis* spell at will,
but you can target only objects that aren’t being worn or carried.

#### Ring of the Ram

> *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at
dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of
its charges to attack one creature you can see within 60 feet of you.
The ring produces a spectral ram’s head and makes its attack roll with a
+7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10
force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.

Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring’s charges as an action
to try to break an object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn’t
being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus
for each charge you spend.

#### Ring of Three Wishes

> *Ring, legendary*

While wearing this ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 3
charges to cast the *wish* spell from it. The ring becomes nonmagical
when you use the last charge.

#### Ring of Warmth

> *Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you have resistance to cold damage. In
addition, you and everything you wear and carry are unharmed by
temperatures as low as

−50 degrees Fahrenheit.

#### Ring of Water Walking

> *Ring, uncommon*

While wearing this ring, you can stand on and move across any liquid
surface as if it were solid ground.

#### Ring of X-ray Vision

> *Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command
word. When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1
minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects
within that radius appear transparent and don’t prevent light from
passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch
of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances
block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.

> Whenever you use the ring again before taking a

long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain
one level of exhaustion.

#### Robe of Eyes

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you
gain the following benefits:

-   The robe lets you see in all directions, and you have advantage on
    > Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

-   You have darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.

-   You can see invisible creatures and objects, as well as see into the
    > Ethereal Plane, out to a range of 120 feet.

The eyes on the robe can’t be closed or averted. Although you can close
or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while
wearing this robe.

A *light* spell cast on the robe or a *daylight* spell cast within 5
feet of the robe causes you to be blinded for 1 minute. At the end of
each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for
*light* or DC 15 for *daylight*), ending the blindness on a success.

#### Robe of Scintillating Colors

> *Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at
dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to
cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until
the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds bright light
in a 30-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.
Creatures that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against
you. In addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when
the robe’s power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving
throw or become stunned until the effect ends.

#### Robe of Stars

> *Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This black or dark blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver
stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.

Six stars, located on the robe’s upper front portion, are particularly
large. While wearing this robe, you can use an action to pull off one of
the stars and use it to cast *magic missile* as a 5th-­‐‑level spell.
Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.

While you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane
along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there
until you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You

reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied,
the nearest unoccupied space.

#### Robe of the Archmagi

> *Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock,
> or wizard)*

This elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of white, gray, or
black and adorned with silvery runes. The robe’s color corresponds to
the alignment for which the item was created. A white robe was made for
good, gray for neutral, and black for evil. You can’t attune to a *robe
of the archmagi* that doesn’t correspond to your alignment.

> You gain these benefits while wearing the robe:

-   If you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 15 + your
    > Dexterity modifier.

-   You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other
    > magical effects.

-   Your spell save DC and spell attack bonus each increase by 2.

#### Robe of Useful Items

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it.
While wearing the robe, you can use an action to detach one of the
patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once
the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment.

> The robe has two of each of the following patches:

-   Dagger

-   Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)

-   Steel mirror

-   10-­‐‑foot pole

-   Hempen rope (50 feet, coiled)

-   Sack

In addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches. The GM chooses the patches
or determines them randomly.

> **d100 Patch**
>
> 01–08 Bag of 100 gp
>
> 09–15 Silver coffer (1 foot long, 6 inches wide and deep) worth 500 gp
>
> 16–22 Iron door (up to 10 feet wide and 10 feet high,
>
> barred on one side of your choice), which you can place in an opening
> you can reach; it conforms to fit the opening, attaching and hinging
> itself
>
> 23–30 10 gems worth 100 gp each
>
> 31–44 Wooden ladder (24 feet long) 45–51 A riding horse with saddle
> bags

> 52–59 Pit (a cube 10 feet on a side), which you can place on the
> ground within 10 feet of you

>
> 76–83 Spell scroll containing one spell of 1st to 3rd level
>
> 84–90 2 mastiffs
>
> 91–96 Window (2 feet by 4 feet, up to 2 feet deep), which you can
> place on a vertical surface you can reach
>
> 97–00 Portable ram

#### Rod of Absorption

> *Rod, very rare (requires attunement)*

While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that
is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed
spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell
itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell
when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy
over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of
energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the
rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.

When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy
the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many
levels of spell energy it currently has stored.

If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored
in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can
create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell
slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place
of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you
can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-­‐‑level spell slot.

A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already.
A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining
becomes nonmagical.

#### Rod of Alertness

> *Rod, very rare (requires attunement)*

This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.

***Alertness.*** While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.

***Spells.*** While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one
of the following spells from it:

> *detect evil and good*, *detect magic*, *detect poison and disease*,
> or *see invisibility.*

***Protective Aura.*** As an action, you can plant the haft end of the
rod in the ground, whereupon the rod’s head sheds bright light in a
60-­‐‑foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that
bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1
bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any
invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.

> The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends

after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from
the ground. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

#### Rod of Lordly Might

> *Rod, legendary (requires attunement)*

This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that
grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has
properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row
along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.

***Six Buttons.*** You can press one of the rod’s six buttons as a bonus
action. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or
until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to
its normal form.

> If you press **button 1**, the rod becomes a *flame*

*tongue*, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s
flanged head.

> If you press **button 2**, the rod’s flanged head folds

down and two crescent-­‐‑shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod
into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with it.

> If you press **button 3**, the rod’s flanged head folds

down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle
lengthens into a 6-­‐‑foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear
that grants a

+3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

If you press **button 4**, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to
50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at
the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3
inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The
pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring
causes the rod to revert to its normal form.

> If you press **button 5**, the rod transforms into a

handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10

bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and
other barriers.

> If you press **button 6**, the rod assumes or remains

in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if
this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic
north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth
beneath the ground or your height above it.

***Drain Life.*** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the
rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.
On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you
regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This
property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

***Paralyze.*** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the
rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On
a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a
success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

***Terrify.*** While holding the rod, you can use an action to force
each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute.
A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can’t
be used again until the next dawn.

#### Rod of Rulership

> *Rod, rare (requires attunement)*

You can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each
creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each
target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you
for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its
trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do
something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this
way. The rod can’t be used again until the next dawn.

#### Rod of Security

> *Rod, very rare*

While holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod
then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you
can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose
the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely
glade, cheery tavern,

immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else
you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough
water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be
interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For
example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it
is taken outside the extraplanar space.

For each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if
it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don’t age while in the paradise,
although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for
up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).

When the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors
reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an
unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can’t be used again
until ten days have passed.

#### Rope of Climbing

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

This 60-­‐‑foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to
3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak
the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command
the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10
feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your
turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or
until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself
securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself,
or to coil itself for carrying.

If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-­‐‑ foot intervals
along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-­‐‑foot length
and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5
minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0
hit points, it is destroyed.

#### Rope of Entanglement

> *Wondrous item, rare*

This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of
the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end
darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you.
The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become
restrained.

You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second
command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make
a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice). On a success, the
creature is no longer restrained by the rope.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5
minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0
hit points, it is destroyed.

#### Scarab of Protection

> *Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

If you hold this beetle-­‐‑shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an
inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It
provides two benefits while it is on your person:

-   You have advantage on saving throws against spells.

-   The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a
    > necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead
    > creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn
    > the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into
    > powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.

#### Scimitar of Speed

> *Weapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon. In addition, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action
on each of your turns.

#### Shield, +1, +2, or +3

> *Armor (shield), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)*

While holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC determined by the
shield’s rarity. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus
to AC.

#### Shield of Missile Attraction

> *Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)*

While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged
weapon attacks.

***Curse.*** This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you
are targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic. Removing the
shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is
made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to
become the target instead.

#### Slippers of Spider Climbing

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across
vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your
hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
However, the slippers don’t allow you to move this way on a slippery
surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.

#### Sovereign Glue

> *Wondrous item, legendary*

This viscous, milky-­‐‑white substance can form a permanent adhesive
bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that
has been coated inside with *oil of slipperiness.* When found, a
container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-­‐‑foot square surface. The glue
takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be
broken only by the application of *universal solvent* or *oil of
etherealness*, or with a *wish* spell.

#### Spell Scroll

> *Scroll, varies*

A *spell scroll* bears the words of a single spell, written in a
mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can use
an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to
provide any of the spell’s components. Otherwise, the scroll is
unintelligible.

> If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a

higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check
using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it
successfully. The

DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the

> spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect. Once the spell
> is cast, the words on the scroll fade,

and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw
DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the
Spell Scroll table.

> The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within
> 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC
> 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in
> one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your
> Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves
> 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must

> 4d10 force damage.
>
> If you attempt to control a sphere that is under

expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from
it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: *cure
wounds* (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), *lesser restoration* (2

bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains

***Retributive Strike.*** You can use an action to break the staff over
your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike.
The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion
that expands to fill a 30-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of
existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you
take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff.
Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on
how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following
table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

> **Distance from Origin Damage**
>
> 10 ft. away or closer 8 × the number of charges in the staff 11 to 20
> ft. away 6 × the number of charges in the staff 21 to 30 ft. away 4 ×

#### Staff of Striking

> *Staff, very rare (requires attunement)*

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus
to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The staff has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using it, you
can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the
target takes an extra 1d6 force damage. The staff regains 1d6 + 4
expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a
d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.

#### Staff of Swarming Insects

> *Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer,
> warlock, or wizard)*

This staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at
dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a swarm of
insects consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses.

***Spells.*** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend
some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using
your spell save DC: *giant insect* (4 charges) or *insect plague* (5
charges).

***Insect Cloud.*** While holding the staff, you can use an action and
expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread
out in a 30-­‐‑foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes,
making the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. The swarm
moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles
per hour disperses the swarm and ends the effect.

#### Staff of the Magi

> *Staff, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or
> wizard)*

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus
to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a
+2 bonus to spell attack rolls.

2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a
d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12 + 1 charges.

***Spell Absorption.*** While holding the staff, you have advantage on
saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction
when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do,
the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and
gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell’s level.
However, if doing so brings the staff’s total number of charges above
50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see
below).

> ***Spells.*** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend
> some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using

your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike.
The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion
that expands to fill a 30-­‐‑foot-­‐‑radius sphere centered on it.

#### Staff of the Python

> *Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock)*

You can use an action to speak this staff’s command word and throw the
staff on the ground within 10 feet of you. The staff becomes a giant
constrictor snake under your control and acts on its own initiative
count. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you
return the staff to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by the
snake.

On your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet
of you and you aren’t incapacitated. You decide what action the snake
takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a
general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its
staff form. The staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake
reverts to staff form before losing all its hit points, it regains all
of them.

#### Staff of the Woodlands

> *Staff, rare (requires attunement by a druid)*

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus
to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you have a +2
bonus to spell attack rolls.

The staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 +
4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a
d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical
quarterstaff.

> ***Spells.*** You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff’s
> charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell
> save DC: *animal friendship* (1 charge), *awaken* (5 charges),
> *barkskin* (2 charges), *locate animals or plants* (2 charges), *speak
> with animals* (1 charge), *speak with plants* (3 charges), or *wall of
> thorns* (6 charges).

You can also use an action to cast the *pass without trace* spell from
the staff without using any charges. ***Tree Form.*** You can use an
action to plant one end

of the staff in fertile earth and expend 1 charge to transform the staff
into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a
5-­‐‑foot-­‐‑diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a
20-­‐‑foot radius.

The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of transmutation
magic if targeted by *detect magic*. While touching the tree and using
another action to speak its command word, you return the staff to its
normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff.

#### Staff of Thunder and Lightning

> *Staff, very rare (requires attunement)*

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus
to attack and damage rolls made with it. It also has the following
additional properties. When one of these properties is used, it can’t be
used again until the next dawn.

***Lightning.*** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you
can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 lightning damage.

***Thunder.*** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can
cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder, audible out to 300 feet. The
target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or
become stunned until the end of your next turn.

***Lightning Strike.*** You can use an action to cause a bolt of
lightning to leap from the staff’s tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and
120 feet long. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity
saving throw, taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.

***Thunderclap.*** You can use an action to cause the staff to issue a
deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60
feet of you (not including you) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes
deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half
damage and isn’t deafened.

***Thunder and Lightning.*** You can use an action to use the Lightning
Strike and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so doesn’t
expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.

#### Staff of Withering

> *Staff, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock)*

This staff has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals
damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to deal an
extra 2d10 necrotic damage to the target. In addition, the target must
succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw

or have disadvantage for 1 hour on any ability check or saving throw
that uses Strength or Constitution.

#### Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals

> *Wondrous item, rare*

If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its
command word and summon an earth elemental, as if you had cast the
*conjure elemental* spell. The stone can’t be used this way again until
the next dawn. The stone weighs 5 pounds.

#### Stone of Good Luck (Luckstone)

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While this polished agate is on your person, you gain a +1 bonus to
ability checks and saving throws.

#### Sun Blade

> *Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)*

This item appears to be a longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you
can use a bonus action to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into
existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this
magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with
shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the *sun blade*.

> You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls

made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing
damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8
radiant damage.

The sword’s luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-­‐‑foot radius and
dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the
blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of
bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a
minimum of 10 feet each.

#### Sword of Life Stealing

> *Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)*

When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the
attack roll, that target takes an extra 3d6 necrotic damage, provided
that the target isn’t a construct or an undead. You gain temporary hit
points equal to the extra damage dealt.

#### Sword of Sharpness

> *Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), very rare (requires
> attunement)*

When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your
weapon damage dice against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack
roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage. Then roll another
d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target’s limbs, with the
effect of such loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb to
sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.

In addition, you can speak the sword’s command word to cause the blade
to shed bright light in a 10-­‐‑ foot radius and dim light for an
additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the
sword puts out the light.

#### Sword of Wounding

> *Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)*

Hit points lost to this weapon’s damage can be regained only through a
short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other
means.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic
weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded
creature’s turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you’ve
wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw,
ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success.
Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it,
can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the
effect of such wounds on it on a success.

#### Talisman of Pure Good

> *Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of good
> alignment)*

This talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness. A creature that is neither
good nor evil in alignment takes 6d6 radiant damage upon touching the
talisman. An evil creature takes 8d6 radiant damage upon touching the
talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it
ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

If you are a good cleric or paladin, you can use the talisman as a holy
symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or
hold it.

The talisman has 7 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can
use an action to expend 1 charge from it and choose one creature you can
see on the

ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of evil alignment, a
flaming fissure opens under it. The target must succeed on a DC 20
Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed,
leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its
existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman disperses into
motes of golden light and is destroyed.

#### Talisman of the Sphere

> *Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

When you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to control a *sphere of
annihilation* while you are holding this talisman, you double your
proficiency bonus on the check. In addition, when you start your turn
with control over a *sphere of annihilation*, you can use an action to
levitate it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 × your
Intelligence modifier.

#### Talisman of Ultimate Evil

> *Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of evil
> alignment)*

This item symbolizes unrepentant evil. A creature that is neither good
nor evil in alignment takes 6d6 necrotic damage upon touching the
talisman. A good creature takes 8d6 necrotic damage upon touching the
talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it
ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

If you are an evil cleric or paladin, you can use the talisman as a holy
symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or
hold it.

The talisman has 6 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can
use an action to expend 1 charge from the talisman and choose one
creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target
is of good alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. The target must
succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and
be destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no
trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman
dissolves into foul-­‐‑smelling slime and is destroyed.

#### Tome of Clear Thought

> *Wondrous item, very rare*

This book contains memory and logic exercises, and its words are charged
with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer
studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your
Intelligence score increases by 2, as does your

maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it
in a century.

#### Tome of Leadership and Influence

> *Wondrous item, very rare*

This book contains guidelines for influencing and charming others, and
its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of
6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its
guidelines, your Charisma score increases by 2, as does your maximum for
that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a
century.

#### Tome of Understanding

> *Wondrous item, very rare*

This book contains intuition and insight exercises, and its words are
charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or
fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your
Wisdom score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The
manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.

#### Trident of Fish Command

> *Weapon (trident), uncommon (requires attunement)*

This trident is a magic weapon. It has 3 charges. While you carry it,
you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast *dominate beast* (save
DC 15) from it on a beast that has an innate swimming speed. The trident
regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Universal Solvent

> *Wondrous item, legendary*

This tube holds milky liquid with a strong alcohol smell. You can use an
action to pour the contents of the tube onto a surface within reach. The
liquid instantly dissolves up to 1 square foot of adhesive it touches,

When you roll a 20 on your attack roll with this magic weapon, your
critical hit deals an extra 2d6 damage of the weapon’s type.

#### Vorpal Sword

> attunement)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.

When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon
and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature’s
heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without the lost head. A
creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage,
doesn’t have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides
that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this
weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from
the hit.

#### Wand of Enemy Detection

> *Wand, rare (requires attunement)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and
expend 1 charge to speak its command word. For the next minute, you know
the direction of the nearest creature hostile to you within 60 feet, but
not its distance from you. The wand can sense the presence of hostile
creatures that are ethereal, invisible, disguised, or hidden, as well as
those in plain sight. The effect ends if you stop holding the wand.

amber light. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom
saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is
frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move
as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space
within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it
can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that
prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can
use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can
repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional
charge you expend.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes

> *Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the *lightning bolt* spell (save
DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-­‐‑level version of the
spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional
charge you expend.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes
and is destroyed.

#### Wand of Magic Detection

> *Wand, uncommon*

This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge as an
action to cast the *detect magic* spell from it. The wand regains 1d3
expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Wand of Magic Missiles

> *Wand, uncommon*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the *magic missile* spell from
it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-­‐‑level version of the spell. You
can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you
expend.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 of its charges to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip
toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must
succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1
minute. At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can repeat the
saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes
and is destroyed.

#### Wand of Polymorph

> *Wand, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 of its charges to cast the *polymorph* spell (save DC 15) from
it.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes
and is destroyed.

#### Wand of Secrets

> *Wand, uncommon*

The wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 of its charges, and if a secret door or trap is within 30 feet
of you, the wand

pulses and points at the one nearest to you. The wand regains 1d3
expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Wand of the War Mage, +1, +2, or +3

> *Wand, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3) (requires
> attunement by a spellcaster)*

While holding this wand, you gain a bonus to spell attack rolls
determined by the wand’s rarity. In addition, you ignore half cover when
making a spell attack.

#### Wand of Web

> *Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 of its charges to cast the *web* spell (save DC 15) from it.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes
and is destroyed.

#### Wand of Wonder

> *Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 of its charges and choose a target within 120 feet of you. The
target can be a creature, an object, or a point in space. Roll d100 and
consult the following table to discover what happens.

If the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, the spell’s save
DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its range
becomes 120 feet if it isn’t already.

If an effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include
the target. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the GM randomly
determines which ones are affected.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust
and is destroyed.

>
> 11–15 You are stunned until the start of your next turn,
>
> believing something awesome just happened. 16–20 You cast gust of
> wind.

>
> 26–30 You cast stinking cloud.
>
> 31–33 Heavy rain falls in a 60-­‐foot radius centered on

> a rat appears.
>
> 37–46 You cast lightning bolt.
>
> 47–49 A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 30-­‐foot radius
> centered on the target. The area becomes heavily obscured. The
> butterflies remain for 10 minutes.
>
> 50–53 You enlarge the target as if you had cast enlarge/reduce. If the
> target can’t be affected by that spell, or if you didn’t target a
> creature, you become the target.
>
> 54–58 You cast darkness.
>
> 59–62 Grass grows on the ground in a 60-­‐foot radius centered on the
> target. If grass is already there, it grows to ten times its normal
> size and remains overgrown for 1 minute.
>
> 63–65 An object of the GM’s choice disappears into the Ethereal Plane.

> 24 hours.
>
> 88–90 A stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each worth 1 gp, shoots from the

> bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided
> equally among all creatures in the line.
>
> 91–95 A burst of colorful shimmering light extends from you in a
> 30-­‐foot radius. You and each creature in the area that can see must

>
> 96–97 The target’s skin turns bright blue for 1d10 days.
>
> If you chose a point in space, the creature nearest to that point is

>
> 98–00 If you targeted a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution

#### Weapon, +1, +2, or +3

> *Weapon (any), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)*

You have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
The bonus is determined by the weapon’s rarity.

#### Well of Many Worlds

> *Wondrous item, legendary*

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a
handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold and place the *well of many worlds* on a
solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-­‐‑way portal to another world
or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides
where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking
hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once *well of many
worlds* has opened a portal, it can’t do so again for 1d8 hours.

#### Wind Fan

> *Wondrous item, uncommon*

While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the *gust of wind*
spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn’t be used again
until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a
cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless,
nonmagical tatters.

#### Winged Boots

> *Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your
walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at
once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute
from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you
descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.

> The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for

every 12 hours they aren’t in use.

#### Wings of Flying

> *Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command
word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on
your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action.
The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you
can’t use them again for 1d12 hours.

> **Sentient Magic Items**

Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might
be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or
self-­‐‑aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the
item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals,
bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to
its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.

Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest
sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never
sentient.

Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM’s control. Any
activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its
wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the
item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the
relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties
or even turn them against the wielder.

### Creating Sentient Magic Items

When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item’s
persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions
described here.

#### Abilities

A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You
can choose the item’s abilities or determine them randomly. To determine
them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and
totaling the rest.

#### Communication

A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its
emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud.
You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table.

> **d100 Communication**
>
> 01–60 The item communicates by transmitting emotion
>
> to the creature carrying or wielding it. 61–90 The item can speak,
> read, and understand one
>
> or more languages.
>
> 91–00 The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages.
> In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any
> character that carries or wields it.

#### Senses

> With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its
> surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll
> on the following table.
>
> **d4 Senses**

1.  Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet.

2.  Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet

3.  Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet.

4.  Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.

#### Alignment

> A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might
> suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the
> following table.

  > **d100**   > **Alignment**       > **d100**   > **Alignment**
  ------------ ------------------ -- ------------ -------------------
  > 01–15      > Lawful good         > 74–85      > Chaotic neutral
  > 16–35      > Neutral good        > 86–89      > Lawful evil
  > 36–50      > Chaotic good        > 90–96      > Neutral evil
  > 51–63      > Lawful neutral      > 97–00      > Chaotic evil
  > 64–73      > Neutral                          

#### Special Purpose

> You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the
> exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns
> with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating
> from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the
> item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its
> activated properties. You can pick a special purpose or roll on the
> following table.
>
> **d10 Purpose**

1.  *Aligned:* The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a
    > diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is never neutral.)

2.  *Bane:* The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of a
    > particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls,
    > or wizards.

3.  *Protector:* The item seeks to defend a particular race or kind of
    > creature, such as elves or druids.

4.  *Crusader:* The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or

destroy the servants of a particular deity.

1.  Templar: The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a
    > particular deity.

2.  *Destroyer:* The item craves destruction and goads its

> user to fight arbitrarily.

1.  *Glory Seeker:* The item seeks renown as the greatest magic item in
    > the world, by establishing its user as a famous or
    > notorious figure.

2.  *Lore Seeker:* The item craves knowledge or is determined to solve a
    > mystery, learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy.

3.  *Destiny Seeker:* The item is convinced that it and its

> wielder have key roles to play in future events.

1.  *Creator Seeker:* The item seeks its creator and wants to understand
    > why it was created.

### Conflict

> A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and
> alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s
> alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs,
> the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma
> check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the
> following demands:

-   The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.

-   The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item
    > finds repugnant.

-   The item demands that its wielder pursue the item’s goals to the
    > exclusion of all other goals.

-   The item demands to be given to someone else. If its wielder refuses
    > to comply with the item’s

> wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:

-   Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.

-   Suppress one or more of its activated properties.

-   Attempt to take control of its wielder.

> If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the
> wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the
> item’s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by
> the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow
> the item’s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the
> saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to
> control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power
> again until the next dawn.

Artifacts
---------

#### Orb of Dragonkind

> *Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)*

Ages past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons.
When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked
their greatest magic, forging five *Orbs of Dragonkind* (or *Dragon
Orbs*) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the
five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a
victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then
destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.

As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or
faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic
has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their
primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some
measure of control over dragons.

Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents
any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality
might find themselves enslaved to an orb.

An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When
used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside
it.

While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s
depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma
check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you
remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb
for as long as you remain attuned to it.

While you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your
attunement to it, and the orb casts *suggestion* on you at will (save DC
18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon
essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a
particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the
world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM
decides.

> ***Random Properties.*** An *Orb of Dragonkind* has the

following random properties:

-   2 minor beneficial properties

-   1 minor detrimental property

-   1 major detrimental property

***Spells.*** The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges
daily at dawn. If you control the

orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of
the following spells (save DC

> 18\) from it: *cure wounds* (5th-­‐‑level version, 3 charges), *daylight*
> (1 charge), *death ward* (2 charges), or *scrying* (3 charges).
>
> You can also use an action to cast the *detect magic*

spell from the orb without using any charges.

***Call Dragons.*** While you control the orb, you can use an action to
cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all
directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to
the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities
such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb
might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once
you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.

> ***Destroying an Orb.*** An *Orb of Dragonkind* appears

fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and
breath weapons of dragons. A *disintegrate* spell or one good hit from a
+3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.

Monsters
========

A monster’s statistics, sometimes referred to as its **stat block**,
provide the essential information that you need to run the monster.

### Size

A monster can be Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. The
Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular
size controls in combat. See the *Player’s Handbook* for more
information on creature size and space.

#### Size Categories

> **Size Space Examples**
>
> Tiny 2½ by 2½ ft. Imp, sprite
>
> Small 5 by 5 ft. Giant rat, goblin
>
> Medium 5 by 5 ft. Orc, werewolf
>
> Large 10 by 10 ft. Hippogriff, ogre
>
> Huge 15 by 15 ft. Fire giant, treant Gargantuan 20 by 20 ft. or larger
> Kraken, purple worm

##### Modifying Creatures

> Despite the versatile collection of monsters in this book, you might
> be at a loss when it comes to finding the perfect creature for part of
> an adventure. Feel free to tweak an existing creature to make it into
> something more useful for you, perhaps by borrowing a trait or two
> from a different monster or by using a **variant** or **template**,
> such as the ones in this book. Keep in mind that modifying a monster,
> including when you apply a template to it, might change its challenge
> rating.

### Type

A monster’s type speaks to its fundamental nature. Certain spells, magic
items, class features, and other effects in the game interact in special
ways with creatures of a particular type. For example, an *arrow of
dragon slaying* deals extra damage not only to dragons but also other
creatures of the dragon type, such as dragon turtles and wyverns.

The game includes the following monster types, which have no rules of
their own.

> **Aberrations** are utterly alien beings. Many of

them have innate magical abilities drawn from the creature’s alien mind
rather than the mystical forces of the world. The quintessential
aberrations are aboleths, beholders, mind flayers, and slaadi.

> **Beasts** are nonhumanoid creatures that are a

natural part of the fantasy ecology. Some of them

have magical powers, but most are unintelligent and lack any society or
language. Beasts include all varieties of ordinary animals, dinosaurs,
and giant versions of animals.

> **Celestials** are creatures native to the Upper

Planes. Many of them are the servants of deities, employed as messengers
or agents in the mortal realm and throughout the planes. Celestials are
good by nature, so the exceptional celestial who strays from a good
alignment is a horrifying rarity. Celestials include angels, couatls,
and pegasi.

> **Constructs** are made, not born. Some are

programmed by their creators to follow a simple set of instructions,
while others are imbued with sentience and capable of independent
thought. Golems are the iconic constructs. Many creatures native to the
outer plane of Mechanus, such as modrons, are constructs shaped from the
raw material of the plane by the will of more powerful creatures.

> **Dragons** are large reptilian creatures of ancient

origin and tremendous power. True dragons, including the good metallic
dragons and the evil chromatic dragons, are highly intelligent and have
innate magic. Also in this category are creatures distantly related to
true dragons, but less powerful, less intelligent, and less magical,
such as wyverns and pseudodragons.

> **Elementals** are creatures native to the elemental

planes. Some creatures of this type are little more than animate masses
of their respective elements, including the creatures simply called
elementals. Others have biological forms infused with elemental energy.
The races of genies, including djinn and efreet, form the most important
civilizations on the elemental planes. Other elemental creatures include
azers, invisible stalkers, and water weirds.

> **Fey** are magical creatures closely tied to the forces

of nature. They dwell in twilight groves and misty forests. In some
worlds, they are closely tied to the Feywild, also called the Plane of
Faerie. Some are also found in the Outer Planes, particularly the planes
of Arborea and the Beastlands. Fey include dryads, pixies, and satyrs.

> **Fiends** are creatures of wickedness that are native

to the Lower Planes. A few are the servants of deities, but many more
labor under the leadership of archdevils and demon princes. Evil priests
and mages sometimes summon fiends to the material world to do their
bidding. If an evil celestial is a rarity, a good fiend is almost
inconceivable. Fiends include demons, devils, hell hounds, rakshasas,
and yugoloths.

**Giants** tower over humans and their kind. They are humanlike in
shape, though some have multiple heads (ettins) or deformities
(fomorians). The six varieties of true giant are hill giants, stone
giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, and storm giants.
Besides these, creatures such as ogres and trolls are giants.

> **Humanoids** are the main peoples of a fantasy

gaming world, both civilized and savage, including humans and a
tremendous variety of other species. They have language and culture, few
if any innate magical abilities (though most humanoids can learn
spellcasting), and a bipedal form. The most common humanoid races are
the ones most suitable as player characters: humans, dwarves, elves, and
halflings. Almost as numerous but far more savage and brutal, and almost
uniformly evil, are the races of goblinoids (goblins, hobgoblins, and
bugbears), orcs, gnolls, lizardfolk, and kobolds.

> **Monstrosities** are monsters in the strictest

sense—frightening creatures that are not ordinary, not truly natural,
and almost never benign. Some are the results of magical experimentation
gone awry (such as owlbears), and others are the product of terrible
curses (including minotaurs and yuan-­‐‑ti). They defy categorization,
and in some sense serve as a catch-­‐‑all category for creatures that
don’t fit into any other type.

> **Oozes** are gelatinous creatures that rarely have a

fixed shape. They are mostly subterranean, dwelling in caves and
dungeons and feeding on refuse, carrion, or creatures unlucky enough to
get in their way. Black puddings and gelatinous cubes are among the most
recognizable oozes.

> **Plants** in this context are vegetable creatures, not

ordinary flora. Most of them are ambulatory, and some are carnivorous.
The quintessential plants are the shambling mound and the treant. Fungal
creatures such as the gas spore and the myconid also fall into this
category.

> **Undead** are once-­‐‑living creatures brought to a

horrifying state of undeath through the practice of necromantic magic or
some unholy curse. Undead include walking corpses, such as vampires and
zombies, as well as bodiless spirits, such as ghosts and specters.

#### Tags

A monster might have one or more tags appended to its type, in
parentheses. For example, an orc has the *humanoid (orc)* type. The
parenthetical tags provide additional categorization for certain
creatures. The tags have no rules of their own, but something in the

game, such as a magic item, might refer to them. For instance, a spear
that is especially effective at fighting demons would work against any
monster that has the demon tag.

### Alignment

A monster’s alignment provides a clue to its disposition and how it
behaves in a roleplaying or combat situation. For example, a chaotic
evil monster might be difficult to reason with and might attack
characters on sight, whereas a neutral monster might be willing to
negotiate. See the *Player’s Handbook* for descriptions of the different
alignments.

The alignment specified in a monster’s stat block is the default. Feel
free to depart from it and change a monster’s alignment to suit the
needs of your campaign. If you want a good-­‐‑aligned green dragon or an
evil storm giant, there’s nothing stopping you.

> Some creatures can have **any alignment**. In other

words, you choose the monster’s alignment. Some monster’s alignment
entry indicates a tendency or aversion toward law, chaos, good, or evil.
For example, a berserker can be any chaotic alignment (chaotic good,
chaotic neutral, or chaotic evil), as befits its wild nature.

Many creatures of low intelligence have no comprehension of law or
chaos, good or evil. They don’t make moral or ethical choices, but
rather act on instinct. These creatures are **unaligned**, which means
they don’t have an alignment.

### Armor Class

A monster that wears armor or carries a shield has an Armor Class (AC)
that takes its armor, shield, and Dexterity into account. Otherwise, a
monster’s AC is based on its Dexterity modifier and natural armor, if
any. If a monster has natural armor, wears armor, or carries a shield,
this is noted in parentheses after its AC value.

### Hit Points

A monster usually dies or is destroyed when it drops to 0 hit points.
For more on hit points, see the *Player’s Handbook.*

> A monster’s hit points are presented both as a die

expression and as an average number. For example, a monster with 2d8 hit
points has 9 hit points on average (2 × 4½).

A monster’s size determines the die used to calculate its hit points, as
shown in the Hit Dice by Size table.

#### Hit Dice by Size

  > **Monster Size**   > **Hit Die**   > **Average HP per Die**
  -------------------- --------------- --------------------------
  > Tiny               > d4            > 2½
  > Small              > d6            > 3½
  > Medium             > d8            > 4½
  > Large              > d10           > 5½
  > Huge               > d12           > 6½
  > Gargantuan         > d20           > 10½

> A monster’s Constitution modifier also affects the number of hit
> points it has. Its Constitution modifier is multiplied by the number
> of Hit Dice it possesses, and the result is added to its hit points.
> For example, if a monster has a Constitution of 12 (+1 modifier) and
> 2d8 Hit Dice, it has 2d8 + 2 hit points (average 11).

### Speed

> A monster’s speed tells you how far it can move on its turn. For more
> information on speed, see the *Player’s Handbook.*
>
> All creatures have a walking speed, simply called
>
> the monster’s speed. Creatures that have no form of ground-­‐‑based
> locomotion have a walking speed of 0 feet.
>
> Some creatures have one or more of the following additional movement
> modes.

#### Burrow

> A monster that has a burrowing speed can use that speed to move
> through sand, earth, mud, or ice. A monster can’t burrow through solid
> rock unless it has a special trait that allows it to do so.

#### Climb

> A monster that has a climbing speed can use all or part of its
> movement to move on vertical surfaces. The monster doesn’t need to
> spend extra movement to climb.

#### Fly

> A monster that has a flying speed can use all or part of its movement
> to fly. Some monsters have the ability to **hover**, which makes them
> hard to knock out of the air (as explained in the rules on flying in
> the *Player’s Handbook*). Such a monster stops hovering when it dies.

#### Swim

> A monster that has a swimming speed doesn’t need to spend extra
> movement to swim.

### Ability Scores

> Every monster has six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity,
> Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding
> modifiers. For more information on ability scores and how they’re used
> in play, see the *Player’s Handbook.*

### Saving Throws

> The Saving Throws entry is reserved for creatures that are adept at
> resisting certain kinds of effects. For example, a creature that isn’t
> easily charmed or frightened might gain a bonus on its Wisdom saving
> throws. Most creatures don’t have special saving throw bonuses, in
> which case this section is absent.
>
> A saving throw bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant ability
> modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the
> monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by
> Challenge Rating table).

#### Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> **Skills**
>
> The Skills entry is reserved for monsters that are proficient in one
> or more skills. For example, a monster that is very perceptive and
> stealthy might have bonuses to Wisdom (Perception) and Dexterity
> (Stealth) checks.
>
> A skill bonus is the sum of a monster’s relevant
>
> ability modifier and its proficiency bonus, which is determined by the
> monster’s challenge rating (as shown in the Proficiency Bonus by
> Challenge Rating table). Other modifiers might apply. For instance, a

monster might have a larger-­‐‑than-­‐‑expected bonus (usually double
its proficiency bonus) to account for its heightened expertise.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities

Some creatures have vulnerability, resistance, or immunity to certain
types of damage. Particular creatures are even resistant or immune to
damage from nonmagical attacks (a magical attack is an attack delivered
by a spell, a magic item, or another magical source). In addition, some
creatures are immune to certain conditions.

### Senses

The Senses entry notes a monster’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, as
well as any special senses the monster might have. Special senses are
described below.

#### Blindsight

A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying
on sight, within a specific radius.

Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have
this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened
senses, such as bats and true dragons.

If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this
effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum
range of its perception.

#### Darkvision

A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius.
The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright
light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can’t
discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live
underground have this special sense.

##### Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies

> Assume that a creature is proficient with its armor, weapons, and
> tools. If you swap them out, you decide whether the creature is
> proficient with its new equipment.
>
> For example, a hill giant typically wears hide armor and wields a
> greatclub. You could equip a hill giant with chain mail and a greataxe
> instead, and assume the giant is proficient with both, one or the
> other, or neither.
>
> See the *Player’s Handbook* for rules on using armor or weapons
> without proficiency.

#### Tremorsense

A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of
vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the monster and the
source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or
substance. Tremorsense can’t be used to detect flying or incorporeal
creatures. Many burrowing creatures, such as ankhegs and umber hulks,
have this special sense.

#### Truesight

A monster with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and
magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically
detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and
perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is
transformed by magic. Furthermore, the monster can see into the Ethereal
Plane within the same range.

### Languages

The languages that a monster can speak are listed in alphabetical order.
Sometimes a monster can understand a language but can’t speak it, and
this is noted in its entry. A “—” indicates that a creature neither
speaks nor understands any language.

#### Telepathy

Telepathy is a magical ability that allows a monster to communicate
mentally with another creature within a specified range. The contacted
creature doesn’t need to share a language with the monster to
communicate in this way with it, but it must be able to understand at
least one language. A creature without telepathy can receive and respond
to telepathic messages but can’t initiate or terminate a telepathic
conversation.

A telepathic monster doesn’t need to see a contacted creature and can
end the telepathic contact at any time. The contact is broken as soon as
the two creatures are no longer within range of each other or if the
telepathic monster contacts a different creature within range. A
telepathic monster can initiate or terminate a telepathic conversation
without using an action, but while the monster is incapacitated, it
can’t initiate telepathic contact, and any current contact is
terminated.

> A creature within the area of an *antimagic field* or

in any other location where magic doesn’t function can’t send or receive
telepathic messages.

### Challenge

> A monster’s **challenge rating** tells you how great a threat the
> monster is. An appropriately equipped and well-­‐‑rested party of four
> adventurers should be able to defeat a monster that has a challenge
> rating equal to its level without suffering any deaths. For example, a
> party of four 3rd-­‐‑level characters should find a monster with a
> challenge rating of 3 to be a worthy challenge, but not a deadly one.
>
> Monsters that are significantly weaker than 1st-­‐‑ level characters
> have a challenge rating lower than 1. Monsters with a challenge rating
> of 0 are insignificant except in large numbers; those with no
> effective attacks are worth no experience points, while those that
> have attacks are worth 10 XP each.
>
> Some monsters present a greater challenge than
>
> even a typical 20th-­‐‑level party can handle. These monsters have a
> challenge rating of 21 or higher and are specifically designed to test
> player skill.

#### Experience Points

> The number of experience points (XP) a monster is worth is based on
> its challenge rating. Typically, XP is awarded for defeating the
> monster, although the GM may also award XP for neutralizing the threat
> posed by the monster in some other manner.
>
> Unless something tells you otherwise, a monster summoned by a spell or
> other magical ability is worth the XP noted in its stat block.

#### Experience Points by Challenge Rating

> **Challenge XP Challenge XP**

### Special Traits

> Special traits (which appear after a monster’s challenge rating but
> before any actions or reactions) are characteristics that are likely
> to be relevant in a combat encounter and that require some
> explanation.

#### Innate Spellcasting

> A monster with the innate ability to cast spells has the Innate
> Spellcasting special trait. Unless noted otherwise, an innate spell of
> 1st level or higher is always cast at its lowest possible level and
> can’t be cast at a higher level. If a monster has a cantrip where its
> level matters and no level is given, use the monster’s challenge
> rating.
>
> An innate spell can have special rules or restrictions. For example, a
> drow mage can innately cast the *levitate* spell, but the spell has a
> “self only” restriction, which means that the spell affects only the
> drow mage.
>
> A monster’s innate spells can’t be swapped out with other spells. If a
> monster’s innate spells don’t require attack rolls, no attack bonus is
> given for them.

#### Spellcasting

> A monster with the Spellcasting special trait has a spellcaster level
> and spell slots, which it uses to cast its spells of 1st level and
> higher (as explained in the *Player’s Handbook*). The spellcaster
> level is also used for any cantrips included in the feature.
>
> The monster has a list of spells known or prepared from a specific
> class. The list might also include spells from a feature in that
> class, such as the Divine Domain feature of the cleric or the Druid
> Circle feature of the druid. The monster is considered a member of
> that class when attuning to or using a magic item that requires
> membership in the class or access to its spell list.
>
> A monster can cast a spell from its list at a higher level if it has
> the spell slot to do so. For example, a drow mage with the
> 3rd-­‐‑level *lightning bolt* spell can cast it as a 5th-­‐‑level
> spell by using one of its 5th-­‐‑level
>
> greater or lesser threat than suggested by its challenge rating.

#### Psionics

A monster that casts spells using only the power of its mind has the
psionics tag added to its Spellcasting or Innate Spellcasting special
trait. This tag carries no special rules of its own, but other parts of
the game might refer to it. A monster that has this tag typically
doesn’t require any components to cast its spells.

### Actions

When a monster takes its action, it can choose from the options in the
Actions section of its stat block or use one of the actions available to
all creatures, such as the Dash or Hide action, as described in the
*Player’s Handbook*.

#### Melee and Ranged Attacks

The most common actions that a monster will take in combat are melee and
ranged attacks. These can be spell attacks or weapon attacks, where the
“weapon” might be a manufactured item or a natural weapon, such as a
claw or tail spike. For more information on different kinds of attacks,
see the *Player’s Handbook*.

> ***Creature vs. Target.*** The target of a melee or

ranged attack is usually either one creature or one target, the
difference being that a “target” can be a creature or an object.

***Hit.*** Any damage dealt or other effects that occur as a result of
an attack hitting a target are described after the “*Hit*” notation. You
have the option of taking average damage or rolling the damage; for this
reason, both the average damage and the die expression are presented.

***Miss.*** If an attack has an effect that occurs on a miss, that
information is presented after the “*Miss:*” notation.

#### Multiattack

A creature that can make multiple attacks on its turn has the
Multiattack action. A creature can’t use Multiattack when making an
opportunity attack, which must be a single melee attack.

#### Ammunition

A monster carries enough ammunition to make its ranged attacks. You can
assume that a monster has 2d4 pieces of ammunition for a thrown weapon
attack, and 2d10 pieces of ammunition for a projectile weapon such as a
bow or crossbow.

### Reactions

If a monster can do something special with its reaction, that
information is contained here. If a creature has no special reaction,
this section is absent.

### Limited Usage

Some special abilities have restrictions on the number of times they can
be used.

***X/Day.*** The notation “X/Day” means a special ability can be used X
number of times and that a monster must finish a long rest to regain
expended uses. For example, “1/Day” means a special ability can be used
once and that the monster must finish a long rest to use it again.

***Recharge X–Y.*** The notation “Recharge X–Y” means a monster can use
a special ability once and that the ability then has a random chance of
recharging during each subsequent round of combat. At the start of each
of the monster’s turns, roll a d6. If the roll is one of the numbers in
the recharge notation, the monster regains the use of the special
ability. The ability also recharges when the monster finishes a short or
long rest.

For example, “Recharge 5–6” means a monster can use the special ability
once. Then, at the start of the monster’s turn, it regains the use of
that ability if it rolls a 5 or 6 on a d6.

> ***Recharge after a Short or Long Rest.*** This notation means that a
> monster can use a special ability once and then must finish a short or
> long rest to use it again.

##### Grapple Rules for Monsters

> Many monsters have special attacks that allow them to quickly grapple
> prey. When a monster hits with such an attack, it doesn’t need to make
> an additional ability check to determine whether the grapple succeeds,
> unless the attack says otherwise.
>
> A creature grappled by the monster can use its action to try to
> escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or
> Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the escape DC in the monster’s
> stat block. If no escape DC is given, assume the DC is 10 + the
> monster’s Strength (Athletics) modifier.

### Equipment

A stat block rarely refers to equipment, other than armor or weapons
used by a monster. A creature that customarily wears clothes, such as a
humanoid, is assumed to be dressed appropriately.

You can equip monsters with additional gear and trinkets however you
like, and you decide how much of a monster’s equipment is recoverable
after the creature is slain and whether any of that equipment is still
usable. A battered suit of armor made for a monster is rarely usable by
someone else, for instance.

If a spellcasting monster needs material components to cast its spells,
assume that it has the material components it needs to cast the spells
in its stat block.

> **Legendary Creatures**

A legendary creature can do things that ordinary creatures can’t. It can
take special actions outside its turn, and it might exert magical
influence for miles around.

If a creature assumes the form of a legendary creature, such as through
a spell, it doesn’t gain that form’s legendary actions, lair actions, or
regional effects.

### Legendary Actions

A legendary creature can take a certain number of special actions—called
legendary actions—outside its turn. Only one legendary action option can
be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A
creature regains its spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
It can forgo using them, and it can’t use them while incapacitated or
otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it can’t use them until
after its first turn in the combat.

### A Legendary Creature’s Lair

A legendary creature might have a section describing its lair and the
special effects it can create while there, either by act of will or
simply by being present. Such a section applies only to a legendary
creature that spends a great deal of time in its lair.

#### Lair Actions

If a legendary creature has lair actions, it can use them to harness the
ambient magic in its lair. On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative
ties), it can use one of its lair action options. It can’t do so while
incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, it
can’t use one until after its first turn in the combat.

#### Regional Effects

The mere presence of a legendary creature can have strange and wondrous
effects on its environment, as

noted in this section. Regional effects end abruptly or dissipate over
time when the legendary creature dies.

***Angelic Weapons.*** The deva’s weapon attacks are magical. When the
deva hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 radiant damage
(included in the attack).

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The deva’s spellcasting ability is Charisma
(spell save DC 17). The deva can innately cast the following spells,
requiring only verbal components:

> At will: *detect evil and good*
>
> 1/day each: *commune*, *raise dead*

***Magic Resistance.*** The deva has advantage on saving throws against

> ***Mace.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

***Healing Touch (3/Day).*** The deva touches another creature. The
target magically regains 20 (4d8 + 2) hit points and is freed from any
curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.

***Change Shape.*** The deva magically polymorphs into a humanoid or
beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back
into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any
equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form
(the deva’s choice).

In a new form, the deva retains its game statistics and ability to
speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special
senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any
statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions,
and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks.

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 9

###### Languages —

> **Challenge** 3 (700 XP)

**Petrifying Gaze.** If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the
basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force
the creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk
isn’t incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically begins to
turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the saving throw at the
end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the
creature is petrified until freed by the *greater restoration* spell or
other magic.

A creature that isn’t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving
throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can’t see the basilisk
until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If
it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the
save.

If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright
light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze.

> **Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and
one to constrict.

> ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
> *Hit:* 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage.

***Constrict.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large
or smaller creature. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17
(2d10 + 6) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the
behir isn’t already constricting a creature, and the target is
restrained until this grapple ends.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5–6).*** The behir exhales a line of
lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that
line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10)
lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

***Swallow.*** The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or
smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also
swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded
and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects
outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of
each of the behir’s turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed
at a time.

> If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn

from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the
creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If
the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and
can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its tentacles once.

***Pincer.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape
DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul doesn’t have
two other creatures grappled.

***Tentacles.*** One creature grappled by the chuul must succeed on a DC
13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Until this
poison ends, the target is paralyzed. The target can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a

***Damage Transfer.*** While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes
only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes
the other half.

***False Appearance.*** While the cloaker remains motionless without its
underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a dark leather cloak.

***Light Sensitivity.*** While in bright light, the cloaker has
disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
sight.

> **Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and
one with its tail.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target is Large or
smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker has advantage
against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target’s head, and the
target is blinded and unable to breathe while the cloaker is attached.
While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only against the target
and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can detach itself by
spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can
take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength
check.

> ***Tail.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
> creature. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

***Moan.*** Each creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear
its moan and that isn’t an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom
saving throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker’s next
turn. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature is immune
to the cloaker’s moan for the next 24 hours

***Phantasms (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The cloaker
magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself if it isn’t in
bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic its actions,
shifting position so as to make it impossible to track which cloaker is
the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area of bright light, the
duplicates disappear.

Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a harmful
spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls randomly to
determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the duplicates. A
creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it can’t see or if it
relies on senses other than sight.

A duplicate has the cloaker’s AC and uses its saving throws. If an
attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against
an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the
target is restrained, and the couatl can’t constrict another target.

***Change Shape.*** The couatl magically polymorphs into a humanoid or
beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back
into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any
equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form
(the couatl’s choice).

> In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics

and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity,
and other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains
any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary
actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lacks. If
the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its bite in that
form.

> ***Echolocation.*** The darkmantle can’t use its blindsight while
> deafened.

***False Appearance.*** While the darkmantle remains motionless, it is
indistinguishable from a cave formation such as a stalactite or
stalagmite.

> **Actions**

***Crush.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to
the target. If the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has
advantage on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target’s
head, and the target is also blinded and unable to breathe while the
darkmantle is attached in this way.

While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other
creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls. The
darkmantle’s speed also becomes 0, it can’t benefit from any bonus to
its speed, and it moves with the target.

A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13
Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach
itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.

***Darkness Aura (1/Day).*** A 15-­‐foot radius of magical darkness
extends out from the darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around
corners. The darkness lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains
concentration, up to 10 minutes (as if concentrating on a spell).
Darkvision can’t penetrate this darkness, and no natural light can
illuminate it. If any of the darkness overlaps with an area of light
created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell creating the light
is dispelled.

***Death Throes.*** When the balor dies, it explodes, and each creature
within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70
(20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area
that aren’t being worn or carried, and it destroys the balor’s weapons.

***Fire Aura.*** At the start of each of the balor’s turns, each
creature within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and flammable
objects in the aura that aren’t being worn or carried ignite. A creature
that touches the balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5
feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.

***Magic Resistance.*** The balor has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

> ***Magic Weapons.*** The balor’s weapon attacks are magical.
>
> **Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The balor makes two attacks: one with its longsword
and one with its whip.

***Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 21 (3d8 + 8) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8) lightning
damage. If the balor scores a critical hit, it rolls damage dice three
times, instead of twice.

***Whip.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage, and the
target must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to
25 feet toward the balor.

***Teleport.*** The balor magically teleports, along with any equipment
it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can
see.

***Fetid Cloud (1/Day).*** A 10-­‐foot radius of disgusting green gas
extends out from the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, and its
area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind
disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must
succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the
start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take
either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can’t take
reactions.

throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a

***Steadfast.*** The devil can’t be frightened while it can see an
allied creature within 30 feet of it.

***Multiattack.*** The devil makes two attacks: one with its beard and
one with its glaive.

***Beard.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC
12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned
in this way, the target can’t regain hit points. The target can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.

***Glaive.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other
than an undead or a construct, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw or lose 5 (1d10) hit points at the start of each of its
turns due to an infernal wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded
target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 5
(1d10). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a

successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check. The wound also closes if the
target receives magical healing.

***Chain.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC

Each animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance
to piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When the
devil uses Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain to
make one additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one
creature of its own but can’t make attacks while grappling. An animated
chain reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points or if
the devil is incapacitated or dies.

##### Reactions

***Unnerving Mask.*** When a creature the devil can see starts its turn
within 30 feet of the devil, the devil can create the illusion that it
looks like one of the creature’s departed loved ones or bitter enemies.

The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or dies.
The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-­‐foot section has AC 5,
30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold,
necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a section is destroyed, it
leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied.
Whenever a creature finishes moving through the frigid air on a turn,
willingly or otherwise, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest
of the wall vanishes.

thoughts of one creature within 60 feet of it. The effect can penetrate
barriers, but 3 feet of wood or dirt, 2 feet of stone, 2 inches of
metal, or a thin sheet of lead blocks it. While the target is in range,
the doppelganger can continue reading its thoughts, as long as the
doppelganger’s concentration isn’t broken (as if concentrating on a
spell). While reading the target’s mind, the doppelganger has advantage
on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, and
Persuasion) checks against the target.

beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into
its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it
is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the
dragon’s choice).

In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice,
ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its
statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new
form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.

Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the

In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice,
ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its
statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new
form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.

***Create Whirlwind.*** A 5-­‐foot-­‐radius, 30-­‐foot-­‐tall cylinder
of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120
feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains
concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the
djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving
throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60
feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with
it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the
whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If
the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to
the nearest space outside the whirlwind.

turn in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or have
its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.

***Gibbering.*** The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any
creature and isn’t incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn
within 20 feet of the mouther and can hear the gibbering must succeed on
a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can’t take
reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine
what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On
a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its
movement to move in a randomly determined

direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a
randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it
can’t make such an attack.

at a point it can see within 15 feet of it. The glob explodes in a
blinding flash of light on impact. Each creature within 5 feet of the
flash must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until
the end of the mouther’s next turn.

***Acid Absorption***. Whenever the golem is subjected to acid damage,
it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to
the acid damage dealt.

***Berserk.*** Whenever the golem starts its turn with 60 hit points or
fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns
while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no
creature is

near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks an object, with
preference for an object smaller than itself. Once the golem goes
berserk, it continues to do so until it is destroyed or regains all its
hit points.

***Immutable Form.*** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that
would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The golem has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

> ***Magic Weapons.*** The golem’s weapon attacks are magical.

##### Actions

> ***Multiattack.*** The golem makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point
maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies
if this attack reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts
until removed by the *greater restoration* spell or other magic.

***Haste (Recharge 5–6).*** Until the end of its next turn, the golem
magically gains a +2 bonus to its AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving
throws, and can use its slam attack as a bonus action.

***Slow (Recharge 5–6).*** The golem targets one or more creatures it
can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can’t use
reactions, its speed is halved, and it can’t make more than one attack
on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a
bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success.

> Medium female humanoid, or back into her

true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment she
is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed. She reverts to her true form
if she dies.

***Etherealness.*** The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the
Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the hag must have a
*heartstone* in her possession.

***Nightmare Haunting (1/Day).*** While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag
magically touches a sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A
*protection from evil and good* spell cast on the target prevents this
contact, as does a *magic circle*. As long as the contact persists, the
target has dreadful visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour,
the target gains no benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is
reduced by 5 (1d10). If this effect reduces the target’s hit point
maximum to 0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is
trapped in the hag’s *soul bag*. The reduction to the target’s hit point
maximum lasts until removed by the *greater restoration* spell or
similar magic.

> ***Amphibious.*** The hag can breathe air and water.

***Horrific Appearance.*** Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30
feet of the hag and can see the hag’s true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute.
A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect
on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or
the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag’s Horrific
Appearance for the next 24 hours.

Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag’s true form
is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial
saving throw. Until the

start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage
on attack rolls against the hag.

> **Actions**
>
> ***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
> *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

***Death Glare.*** The hag targets one frightened creature she can see
within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it must succeed on
a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0 hit points.

***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is
wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an
ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if
the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical
inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but
someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature
must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC
16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is
disguised.

### Half-Dragon Template

A beast, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity can become a half-­‐‑dragon. It
keeps its statistics, except as follows. ***Challenge.*** To avoid

> Silver or white Cold

***Languages.*** The half-­‐‑dragon speaks Draconic in addition to any
other languages it knows.

***New Action: Breath Weapon.*** The half-­‐‑dragon has the breath
weapon of its dragon half. The half-­‐‑ dragon’s size determines how

***Luring Song.*** The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and
giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed
on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The
harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue
singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is
incapacitated.

While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the
songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away
from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the
most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t avoid
opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as
lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the
harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving
throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy’s song for the
next 24 hours.

***Freedom of Movement.*** The kraken ignores difficult terrain, and
magical effects can’t reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It
can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or
being grappled.

> ***Siege Monster.*** The kraken deals double damage to objects and
> structures.
>
> **Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The kraken makes three tentacle attacks, each of
which it can replace with one use of Fling.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 23 (3d8 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or
smaller creature grappled by the kraken, that creature is swallowed, and
the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and
restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside
the kraken, and it takes 42 (12d6) acid damage at the start of each of
the kraken’s turns.

If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature
inside it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw
at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which
fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies,
a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from
the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

***Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 30 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 20 (3d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is
grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is
restrained. The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one
target.

***Fling.*** One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by
the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked
prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3
(1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target
is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18
Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

***Lightning Storm.*** The kraken magically creates three bolts of
lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within
120 feet of it. A target must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

##### Legendary Actions

The kraken can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. The kraken regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

> **Tentacle Attack or Fling.** The kraken makes one tentacle attack or
> uses its Fling.
>
> **Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions).** The kraken uses Lightning
> Storm.
>
> **Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions).** While underwater, the kraken expels
> an ink cloud in a 60-­‐foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners,
> and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the kraken.
> Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there must
> succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison
> damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A
> strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the
> end of the kraken’s next turn.

***Petrifying Gaze.*** When a creature that can see the medusa’s eyes
starts its turn within 30 feet of the medusa, the medusa can force it to
make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn’t incapacitated
and can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the
creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails the
save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained creature
must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming
petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The
petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the *greater
restoration* spell or other magic.

Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving
throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see
the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes
again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the meantime, it must
immediately make the save.

> If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished

surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa
is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze.

the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum
by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target
dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction
to the target’s hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

***Tentacle.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) piercing

other or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw or take 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and be

the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn’t stunned.

on saving throws against all other spells and magical effects.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The rakshasa’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). The rakshasa
can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material
components:

> At will: *detect thoughts*, *disguise self*, *mage hand*, *minor
> illusion*
>
> 3/day each: *charm person*, *detect magic*, *invisibility*, *major
> image*, s*uggestion*
>
> 1/day each: *dominate person*, *fly*, *plane shift*, *true seeing*
>
> **Actions**
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The rakshasa makes two claw attacks.

***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage, and the target is cursed if it is a
creature. The magical curse takes effect whenever the target takes a
short or long rest, filling the target’s thoughts with horrible images
and dreams. The cursed target gains no benefit from finishing a short or
long rest. The curse lasts until it is lifted by a *remove curse* spell
or similar magic.

***Heated Body.*** A creature that touches the remorhaz or hits it with
a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.

> **Actions**

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 40 (6d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage. If the
target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple
ends, the target is restrained, and the remorhaz can’t bite another
target.

***Swallow.*** The remorhaz makes one bite attack against a Medium or
smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature
takes the bite’s damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While
swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover
against attacks and other effects outside the remorhaz, and it takes 21
(6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the remorhaz’s turns.

If the remorhaz takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature
inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures,
which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the remorhaz. If the
remorhaz dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and
can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

***False Appearance.*** While the roper remains motionless, it is
indistinguishable from a normal cave formation, such as a stalagmite.

***Grasping Tendrils.*** The roper can have up to six tendrils at a
time. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to
poison and psychic damage). Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the
roper, which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn. A
tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on
a DC 15 Strength check against it.

***Spider Climb.*** The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

> **Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The roper makes four attacks with its tendrils, uses
Reel, and makes one attack with its bite.

> ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
> *Hit:* 22 (4d8 + 4) piercing damage.

***Tendril.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 50 ft., one
creature. *Hit:* The target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until the

***Iron Scent.*** The rust monster can pinpoint, by scent, the location
of ferrous metal within 30 feet of it.

***Rust Metal.*** Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the rust
monster corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and
cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the
weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the
rust monster is destroyed after dealing damage.

> **Actions**
>
> ***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
> *Hit:* 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

***Antennae.*** The rust monster corrodes a nonmagical ferrous metal
object it can see within 5 feet of it. If the object isn’t being worn or
carried, the touch destroys a 1-­‐foot cube of it. If the object is
being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a DC 11
Dexterity saving throw to avoid the rust monster’s touch.

If the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield being worn
or carried, its takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it
offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0
bonus is destroyed. If the object touched is a held metal weapon, it
rusts as described in the Rust Metal trait.

different, as detailed below. Each creature within 500 feet of the
sphinx and able to hear the roar must make a saving throw.

> **First Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw

*magic missile* spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged
attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a

***Animate Trees (1/Day).*** The treant magically animates one or two
trees it can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same
statistics as a treant, except they have Intelligence and Charisma
scores of 1, they can’t speak, and they have only the Slam action
option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The tree remains
animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more

***Charge.*** If the unicorn moves at least 20 feet straight toward a
target and then hits it with a horn attack on the same turn, the target
takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it
must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The unicorn’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 14). The unicorn can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no components:

> At will: *detect evil and good*, *druidcraft*, *pass without trace*

afflicting the target.

***Teleport (1/Day).*** The unicorn magically teleports itself and up to
three willing creatures it can see within 5 feet of it, along with any

> *Medium undead (shapechanger), lawful evil*

***Shapechanger.*** If the vampire isn’t in sunlight or running water,
it can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of
mist, or back into its true form.

While in bat form, the vampire can’t speak, its walking speed is 5 feet,
and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other than its
size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing transforms with
it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to its true form if it
dies.

While in mist form, the vampire can’t take any actions, speak, or
manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can
hover, and can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there. In
addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without
squeezing, and it can’t pass through water. It has advantage on
Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution

saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the
damage it takes from sunlight.

> ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the vampire fails a saving
> throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Misty Escape.*** When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting
place, the vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the
Shapechanger trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it
isn’t in sunlight or running water. If it can’t transform, it is
destroyed.

While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can’t revert to its vampire
form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be
destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It
is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending
1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.

***Regeneration.*** The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of
its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn’t in sunlight or running
water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water,
this trait doesn’t function at the start of the vampire’s next turn.

***Spider Climb.*** The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

> ***Vampire Weaknesses.*** The vampire has the following flaws:

*Forbiddance.* The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation
from one of the occupants.

> *Harmed by Running Water.* The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends
> its turn in running water.
>
> *Stake to the Heart.* If a piercing weapon made of

wood is driven into the vampire’s heart while the vampire is
incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the
stake is removed.

*Sunlight Hypersensitivity.* The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when it
starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on
attack rolls and ability checks.

> **Actions**
>
> ***Multiattack (Vampire Form Only).*** The vampire makes two attacks,
> only one of which can be a bite attack.
>
> ***Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to
> hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 +

4\) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the vampire can
grapple the target (escape DC 18).

> ***Bite (Bat or Vampire Form Only).** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit,
> reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or a creature that is grappled by
> the vampire, incapacitated,

or restrained. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic
damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to
the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to
that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.
The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A
humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the
following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire’s control.

***Charm.*** The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet
of it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a
DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the
vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to
be heeded and protected. Although the target isn’t under the vampire’s
control, it takes the vampire’s requests or actions in the most
favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for the vampire’s bite
attack.

Each time the vampire or the vampire’s companions do anything harmful to
the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself
on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire
is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or
takes a bonus action to end the effect.

***Children of the Night (1/Day).*** The vampire magically calls 2d4
swarms of bats or rats, provided that the sun isn’t up. While outdoors,
the vampire can call 3d6 wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in
1d4 rounds, acting as allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken
commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until
the vampire dismisses them as a bonus action.

##### Legendary Actions

The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature’s turn. The vampire regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

> **Actions**

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11
Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage
reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned
for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while
poisoned in this way.

***Web (Recharge 5–6).** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 30/60
ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target is restrained by webbing. As an
action, the restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting
the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed
(AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning,
poison, and psychic damage).

To snare its prey, a **giant spider** spins elaborate webs or shoots
sticky strands of webbing from its abdomen. Giant spiders are most
commonly found underground, making their lairs on ceilings or in dark,
web-­‐‑filled crevices. Such lairs are often festooned with web cocoons
holding past victims.

is restrained, and the toad can’t bite another target.

***Swallow.*** The toad makes one bite attack against a Medium or
smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is
swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and
restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside
the toad, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the
toad’s turns. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time.

If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and
can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.

***Ethereal Jaunt.*** As a bonus action, the spider can magically shift
from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, or vice versa.

***Spider Climb.*** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Walker.*** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by
webbing.

> **Actions**

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11
Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage
reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned
for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while
poisoned in this way.

A **phase spider** possesses the magical ability to phase in and out of
the Ethereal Plane. It seems to appear out of nowhere and quickly
vanishes after attacking. Its movement on the Ethereal Plane before
coming back to the Material Plane makes it seem like it can teleport.

Nonplayer Characters
====================

This appendix contains statistics for various humanoid nonplayer
characters (NPCs) that adventurers might encounter during a campaign,
including lowly commoners and mighty archmages. These stat blocks can be
used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.

### Customizing NPCs

There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your
home campaign.

***Racial Traits.*** You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a
halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding
racial traits to an NPC doesn’t alter its challenge rating. For more on
racial traits, see the *Player’s Handbook*.

***Spell Swaps.*** One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace
one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC’s
spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell

***Spellcasting.*** The acolyte is a 1st-­‐level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell
attacks). The acolyte has following cleric spells prepared:

> Cantrips (at will): *light*, *sacred flame*, *thaumaturgy*
>
> 1st level (3 slots): *bless*, *cure wounds*, *sanctuary*

##### Actions

> ***Club.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
> *Hit:* 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage.

**Acolytes** are junior members of a clergy, usually answerable to a
priest. They perform a variety of functions in a temple and are granted
minor spellcasting power by their deities.

> **Archmage**
>
> *Medium humanoid (any race), any alignment*
>
> **Armor Class** 12 (15 with *mage armor*)
>
> **Hit Points** 99 (18d8 + 18)
>
> **Speed** 30 ft.

list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t alter an

NPC’s challenge rating.

***Armor and Weapon Swaps.*** You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s
armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage
can change an NPC’s challenge rating.

***Magic Items.*** The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one
or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might
have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls.
Giving an NPC a potent damage-­‐‑dealing magic item could alter its
challenge rating.

***Magic Resistance.*** The archmage has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** The archmage is an 18th-­‐level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17,

+9 to hit with spell attacks). The archmage can cast

**Archmages** are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters
dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings
and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those
who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to
practice their magic without interruption.

An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an
archmage’s abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage
interlopers.

#### Assassin

> *Medium humanoid (any race), any non-­‐good alignment*
>
> **Armor Class** 15 (studded leather)
>
> **Hit Points** 78 (12d8 + 24)
>
> **Speed** 30 ft.

###### STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA

> **Damage Resistances** poison
>
> **Senses** passive Perception 13
>
> **Languages** Thieves’ cant plus any two languages
>
> **Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP)

***Assassinate.*** During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on
attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn. Any hit the
assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

***Evasion.*** If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it
to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin
instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only
half damage if it fails.

***Sneak Attack.*** Once per turn, the assassin deals an extra 14 (4d6)
damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on
the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the
assassin that isn’t incapacitated and the assassin doesn’t have
disadvantage on the attack roll.

> **Actions**
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The assassin makes two shortsword attacks.

***Shortsword.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a
DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Light Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 80/320 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Trained in the use of poison, **assassins** are remorseless killers who
work for nobles, guildmasters, sovereigns, and anyone else who can
afford them.

#### Bandit

> *Medium humanoid (any race), any non-­‐lawful alignment*
>
> **Armor Class** 12 (leather armor)
>
> **Hit Points** 11 (2d8 + 2)
>
> **Speed** 30 ft.

>
> ***Light Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, range 80
> ft./320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage.

**Bandits** rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or
spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or
famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.

> **Pirates** are bandits of the high seas. They might be

freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be
privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy
nation’s vessels.

#### Bandit Captain

> *Medium humanoid (any race), any non-­‐lawful alignment*
>
> **Armor Class** 15 (studded leather)
>
> **Hit Points** 65 (10d8 + 20)

> **Languages** any two languages **Challenge** 2 (450 XP)
>
> **Actions**

***Multiattack.*** The captain makes three melee attacks: two with its
scimitar and one with its dagger. Or the captain makes two ranged
attacks with its daggers.

> ***Scimitar.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
> target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.
>
> ***Dagger.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or
> range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 +

2)  piercing damage.

##### Reactions

***Parry.*** The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that
would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be
wielding a melee weapon.

It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to
keep a gang of bandits in line. The **bandit captain** has these
qualities in spades.

In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the **pirate
captain** is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect
and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards
and punishment on a regular basis.

> More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate

captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain’s vanity or
ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or
claims not to know anything of the captain’s colorful reputation.

#### Berserker

> *Medium humanoid (any race), any chaotic alignment*
>
> **Armor Class** 13 (hide armor)
>
> **Hit Points** 67 (9d8 + 27)

> **Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

***Reckless.*** At the start of its turn, the berserker can gain
advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack
rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

> **Actions**
>
> ***Greataxe.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
> target. *Hit:* 9 (1d12 + 3) slashing damage.

Hailing from uncivilized lands, unpredictable **berserkers** come
together in war parties and seek conflict wherever they can find it.

#### Commoner

**Druids** dwell in forests and other secluded wilderness locations,
where they protect the natural world from monsters and the encroachment
of civilization. Some are **tribal shamans** who heal the sick, pray to
animal spirits, and provide spiritual guidance.

#### Gladiator

> *Medium humanoid (any race), any alignment*
>
> **Armor Class** 16 (studded leather, shield)
>
> **Hit Points** 112 (15d8 + 45)
>
> **Speed** 30 ft.

***Brave.*** The gladiator has advantage on saving throws against being
frightened.

***Brute.*** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the
gladiator hits with it (included in the attack).

##### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gladiator makes three melee attacks or two ranged
attacks.

> ***Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. and

##### Reactions

***Parry.*** The gladiator adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack
that would hit it. To do so, the gladiator must see the attacker and be
wielding a melee weapon.

**Gladiators** battle for the entertainment of raucous crowds. Some
gladiators are brutal pit fighters who treat each match as a
life-­‐‑or-­‐‑death struggle, while others are professional duelists who
command huge fees but rarely fight to the death.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute,
the knight can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile
creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a
saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear
and understand the knight. A creature can benefit from only one
Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the knight is
incapacitated.

##### Reactions

***Parry.*** The knight adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that
would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding
a melee weapon.

**Knights** are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders,

alignment determines the extent to which a pledge is honored. Whether
undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a knight often travels with

a melee weapon.

**Nobles** wield great authority and influence as members of the upper
class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful
as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of
guards, as well as servants who are commoners.

***Divine Eminence.*** As a bonus action, the priest can expend a spell
slot to cause its melee weapon attacks to magically deal an extra 10
(3d6) radiant damage to a target on a hit. This benefit lasts until the
end of the turn. If the priest expends a spell slot of 2nd level or
higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 1st.
