Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The shambling mound makes two slam attacks. If both
attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape
DC 14), and the shambling mound uses its Engulf on it.

**Slam**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 13 (2d8 + 4)
bludgeoning damage.

**Engulf**: The shambling mound engulfs a Medium or
smaller creature :ref:`srd:grappled` by it. The engulfed target is :ref:`srd:blinded`,
:ref:`srd:restrained`, and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the mound's turns or
take 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the mound moves, the engulfed
target moves with it. The mound can have only one creature engulfed at a
time.
