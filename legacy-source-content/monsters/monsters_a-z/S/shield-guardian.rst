**Bound**: The shield guardian is magically bound to an amulet. As long
as the guardian and its amulet are on the same plane of existence, the
amulet's wearer can telepathically call the guardian to travel to it,
and the guardian knows the distance and direction to the amulet. If the
guardian is within 60 feet of the amulet's wearer, half of any damage
the wearer takes (rounded up) is transferred to the guardian.

**Regeneration**: The shield guardian regains 10 hit points at the start
of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.

**Spell Storing**: A
spellcaster who wears the shield guardian's amulet can cause the
guardian to store one spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, the wearer
must cast the spell on the guardian. The spell has no effect but is
stored within the guardian. When commanded to do so by the wearer or
when a situation arises that was predefined by the spellcaster, the
guardian casts the stored spell with any parameters set by the original
caster, requiring no components. When the spell is cast or a new spell
is stored, any previously stored spell is lost.

**Fist**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 11 (2d6 + 4)
bludgeoning damage.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Shield**: When a creature makes an attack against the wearer of the
guardian's amulet, the guardian grants a +2 bonus to the wearer's AC if
the guardian is within 5 feet of the wearer.
