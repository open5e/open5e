Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Longsword**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 1 slashing damage.

**Shortbow**: *Ranged Weapon Attack*:
+6 to hit, range 40/160 ft., one target. *Hit*: 1 piercing damage, and
the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become
:ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 5 or lower, the
:ref:`srd:poisoned` target falls :ref:`srd:unconscious` for the same duration, or until it
takes damage or another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

**Heart Sight**: The sprite touches a creature and magically knows the
creature's current emotional state. If the target fails a DC 10 Charisma
saving throw, the sprite also knows the creature's alignment.
Celestials, fiends, and undead automatically fail the saving throw.

**Invisibility**: The sprite magically turns :ref:`srd:invisible` until it attacks
or casts a spell, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating
on a spell). Any equipment the sprite wears or carries is :ref:`srd:invisible` with
it.
