**Berserk**: Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or 
fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk.
On each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the
nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to
and attack, the golem attacks an object, with preference for an object
smaller than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so
until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.

The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try
to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be
able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15
Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases
being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or
fewer, the golem might go berserk again.

**Aversion of Fire**: If the golem takes fire damage, it has
disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its
next turn.

**Immutable Form**: The golem is immune to any spell or
effect that would alter its form.

**Lightning Absorption**: Whenever the
golem is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage and instead
regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning damage dealt.


**Magic Resistance**: The golem has advantage on saving throws against
spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons**: The golem's weapon
attacks are magical.
