**Aberrant Ground**: The ground in a 10-foot radius around the mouther
is doughlike difficult terrain. Each creature that starts its turn in
that area must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or have its
speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.

**Gibbering**: The
mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any creature and isn't
:ref:`srd:incapacitated`. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the
mouther and can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving
throw. On a failure, the creature can't take reactions until the start
of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its
turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature
takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a
randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee
attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does
nothing if it can't make such an attack.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The gibbering mouther makes one bite attack and, if it
can, uses its Blinding Spittle.

**Bites**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +2 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit*: 17 (5d6) piercing damage. If the
target is Medium or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving
throw or be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. If the target is killed by this damage, it is
absorbed into the mouther.

**Blinding Spittle (Recharge 5-6)**: The
mouther spits a chemical glob at a point it can see within 15 feet of
it. The glob explodes in a blinding flash of light on impact. Each
creature within 5 feet of the flash must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity
saving throw or be :ref:`srd:blinded` until the end of the mouther's next turn.
