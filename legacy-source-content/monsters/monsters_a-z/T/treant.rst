Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The treant makes two slam attacks.

**Slam**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 16 (3d6 + 6)
bludgeoning damage.

**Rock**: *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, range
60/180 ft., one target. *Hit*: 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Animate Trees (1/Day)**: The treant magically animates one or two
trees it can see within 60 feet of it. These trees have the same
statistics as a treant, except they have Intelligence and Charisma
scores of 1, they can't speak, and they have only the Slam action
option. An animated tree acts as an ally of the treant. The tree remains
animate for 1 day or until it dies; until the treant dies or is more
than 120 feet from the tree; or until the treant takes a bonus action to
turn it back into an inanimate tree. The tree then takes root if
possible.
