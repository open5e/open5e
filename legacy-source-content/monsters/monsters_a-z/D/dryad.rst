Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Club**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +2 to hit (+6 to hit with :ref:`srd:shillelagh`),
reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d8 +
4) bludgeoning damage with :ref:`srd:shillelagh`.

**Fey Charm**: The dryad targets
one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet of her. If the
target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw
or be magically :ref:`srd:charmed`. The :ref:`srd:charmed` creature regards the dryad as a
trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't
under the dryad's control, it takes the dryad's requests or actions in
the most favorable way it can. Each time the dryad or its allies do
anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending
the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours
or until the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the
target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw
is successful, the target is immune to the dryad's Fey Charm for the
next 24 hours.

The dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts
:ref:`srd:charmed` at a time.
