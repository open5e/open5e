Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 10
ft., one target. *Hit*: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold
damage.

**Claw**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

**Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot cone. Each creature
in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 45
(10d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.
