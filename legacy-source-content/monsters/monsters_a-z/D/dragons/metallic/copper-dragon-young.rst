Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 10
ft., one target. *Hit*: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

**Claw**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 11 (2d6 + 4)
slashing damage.

**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon uses one
of the following breath weapons.

**Acid Breath**: The dragon exhales
acid in an 40-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line
must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 40 (9d8) acid damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Slowing Breath**: The dragon exhales gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in
that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it
can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature
can use either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both.
These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with
a successful save.
