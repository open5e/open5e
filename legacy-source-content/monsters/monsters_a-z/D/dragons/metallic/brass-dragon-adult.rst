Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 17
(2d10 + 6) piercing damage.

**Claw**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +11 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.

**Tail**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit*: 15
(2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence**: Each creature of
the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of
it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for
1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is
immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon uses one of the following
breath weapons.

**Fire Breath**: The dragon exhales fire in an 60-foot
line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18
Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (13d6) fire damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Sleep Breath**: The dragon
exhales sleep gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must
succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or fall :ref:`srd:unconscious` for 10
minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or
someone uses an action to wake it.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect**: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack**: The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)**: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of
the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13
(2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon can then
fly up to half its flying speed.
