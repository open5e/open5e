**Fire Breath**: The dragon
exhales fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a
DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) fire damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Weakening Breath**:

must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or have disadvantage on

of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
