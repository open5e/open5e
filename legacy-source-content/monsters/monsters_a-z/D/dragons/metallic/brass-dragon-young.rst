Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 10
ft., one target. *Hit*: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

**Claw**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 11 (2d6 + 4)
slashing damage.

**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon uses one
of the following breath weapons.

**Fire Breath**: The dragon exhales
fire in a 40-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line
must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) fire damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Sleep Breath**: The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature
in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or fall
:ref:`srd:unconscious` for 5 minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the
creature takes damage or someone uses an action to wake it.
