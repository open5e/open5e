Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The devil makes two attacks: one with its beard and one
with its glaive.

**Beard**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5
ft., one creature. *Hit*: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage, and the target
must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1
minute. While :ref:`srd:poisoned` in this way, the target can't regain hit points.
The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Glaive**: *Melee Weapon
Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 8 (1d10 + 3)
slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a
construct, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or lose
5 (1d10) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal
wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the
damage dealt by the wound increases by 5 (1d10). Any creature can take
an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine)
check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.
