Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The devil makes two attacks with its chains.

**Chain**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 11
(2d6 + 4) slashing damage. The target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 14) if the
devil isn't already grappling a creature. Until this grapple ends, the
target is :ref:`srd:restrained` and takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at the start of
each of its turns.

**Animate Chains (Recharges after a Short or Long
Rest)**: Up to four chains the devil can see within 60 feet of it
magically sprout razor-edged barbs and animate under the devil's
control, provided that the chains aren't being worn or carried. Each
animated chain is an object with AC 20, 20 hit points, resistance to
piercing damage, and immunity to psychic and thunder damage. When the
devil uses Multiattack on its turn, it can use each animated chain to
make one additional chain attack. An animated chain can grapple one
creature of its own but can't make attacks while grappling. An animated
chain reverts to its inanimate state if reduced to 0 hit points or if
the devil is :ref:`srd:incapacitated` or dies.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Unnerving Mask**: When a creature the devil can see starts its turn
within 30 feet of the devil, the devil can create the illusion that it
looks like one of the creature's departed loved ones or bitter enemies.
If the creature can see the devil, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom
saving throw or be :ref:`srd:frightened` until the end of its turn.
