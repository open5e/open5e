**Shapechanger**: The imp can use its action to polymorph into a beast

or a spider (20 ft., climb 20 ft.), or back into its true form. Its
statistics are the same in each form, except for the speed changes
noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It
reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Devil's Sight**: Magical darkness
doesn't impede the imp's darkvision.

advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
