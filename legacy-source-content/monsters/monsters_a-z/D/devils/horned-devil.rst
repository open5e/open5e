Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The devil makes three melee attacks: two with its fork
and one with its tail. It can use Hurl Flame in place of any melee
attack.

**Fork**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 15 (2d8 + 6) piercing damage.

**Tail**: *Melee Weapon
Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 10 (1d8 + 6)
piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or a
construct, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or lose
10 (3d6) hit points at the start of each of its turns due to an infernal
wound. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the
damage dealt by the wound increases by 10 (3d6). Any creature can take
an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine)
check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.

**Hurl Flame**: Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 150 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 14 (4d6) fire damage. If the target is a flammable object
that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.
