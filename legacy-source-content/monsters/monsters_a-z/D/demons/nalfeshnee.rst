Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The nalfeshnee uses Horror Nimbus if it can. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 32
(5d10 + 5) piercing damage.

**Claw**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit,
reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage.

**Horror
Nimbus (Recharge 5-6)**: The nalfeshnee magically emits scintillating,
multicolored light. Each creature within 15 feet of the nalfeshnee that
can see the light must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be
:ref:`srd:frightened` for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a
creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
creature is immune to the nalfeshnee's Horror Nimbus for the next 24
hours.

**Teleport**: The nalfeshnee magically teleports, along with any
equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied
space it can see.
