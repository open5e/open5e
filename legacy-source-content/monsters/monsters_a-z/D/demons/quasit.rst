**Shapechanger**: The quasit can use its action to polymorph into a
beast form that resembles a bat (speed 10 ft. fly 40 ft.), a centipede
(40 ft., climb 40 ft.), or a toad (40 ft., swim 40 ft.), or back into
its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for the
speed changes noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't
transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Magic
Resistance**: The quasit has advantage on saving throws against spells
and other magical effects.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Claws (Bite in Beast Form)**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target
must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (2d4) poison
damage and become :ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1 minute. The target can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.

**Scare (1/Day)**: One creature of the quasit's
choice within 20 feet of it must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw
or be :ref:`srd:frightened` for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the quasit is within
line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Invisibility**: The quasit magically turns :ref:`srd:invisible` until it attacks
or uses Scare, or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a
spell). Any equipment the quasit wears or carries is :ref:`srd:invisible` with it.
