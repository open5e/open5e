within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70
(20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area
that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys the balor's weapons.

**Fire Aura**: At the start of each of the balor's turns, each creature
within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in
the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that
touches the balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of
it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.

**Magic Resistance**: The balor has
advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
