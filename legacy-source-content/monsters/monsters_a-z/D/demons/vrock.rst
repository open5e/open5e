Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and one
with its talons.

**Beak**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. *Hit*: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**Talons**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 14 (2d10 + 3)
slashing damage.

**Spores (Recharge 6)**: A 15-foot-radius cloud of
toxic spores extends out from the vrock. The spores spread around
corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution
saving throw or become :ref:`srd:poisoned`. While :ref:`srd:poisoned` in this way, a target
takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the
target also ends the effect on it.

**Stunning Screech (1/Day)**: The
vrock emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of it that
can hear it and that isn't a demon must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution
saving throw or be :ref:`srd:stunned` until the end of the vrock's next turn.
