Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**: For 1 minute, the
duergar magically increases in size, along with anything it is wearing
or carrying. While enlarged, the duergar is Large, doubles its damage
dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and
makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the
duergar lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size
possible in the space available.

**War Pick**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4
to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage, or
11 (2d8 + 2) piercing damage while enlarged.

**Javelin**: *Melee or
Ranged Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, or 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing
damage while enlarged.

**Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long
Rest)**: The duergar magically turns :ref:`srd:invisible` until it attacks, casts a
spell, or uses its Enlarge, or until its concentration is broken, up to
1 hour (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the duergar wears
or carries is :ref:`srd:invisible` with it.
