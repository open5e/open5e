**Shapechanger**: The wereboar can use its action to polymorph into a
boar-humanoid hybrid or into a boar, or back into its true form, which
is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each
form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It
reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Charge (Boar or Hybrid Form
Only)**: If the wereboar moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target
and then hits it with its tusks on the same turn, the target takes an
extra 7 (2d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must
succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`.

**Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**: If the wereboar
takes 14 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is
reduced to 1 hit point instead.
