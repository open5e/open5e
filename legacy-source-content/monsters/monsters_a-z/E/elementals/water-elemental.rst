Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The elemental makes two slam attacks.

**Slam**: Melee
*Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 13 (2d8 + 4)
bludgeoning damage.

**Whelm (Recharge 4-6)**: Each creature in the
elemental's space must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure,
a target takes 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If it is Large or
smaller, it is also :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends,
the target is :ref:`srd:restrained` and unable to breathe unless it can breathe
water. If the saving throw is successful, the target is pushed out of
the elemental's space.

The elemental can grapple one Large creature or up to two Medium or
smaller creatures at one time. At the start of each of the elemental's
turns, each target :ref:`srd:grappled` by it takes 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
A creature within 5 feet of the elemental can pull a creature or object
out of it by taking an action to make a DC 14 Strength and succeeding.
