**Innate
Spellcasting**: The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell
save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no
material components:

**At will**: :ref:`srd:dancing-lights`, :ref:`srd:minor-illusion`,
:ref:`srd:vicious-mockery` 

**Mimicry**: The hag can mimic animal sounds and
humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are
imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Claws**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

**Illusory Appearance**: The hag
covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical
illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size
and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to
end it or if she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold
up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have
smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh.
Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the
illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to
discern that the hag is disguised.

**:ref:`srd:Invisible` Passage**: The hag
magically turns :ref:`srd:invisible` until she attacks or casts a spell, or until
her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While
:ref:`srd:invisible`, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be
tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is :ref:`srd:invisible`
with her.
