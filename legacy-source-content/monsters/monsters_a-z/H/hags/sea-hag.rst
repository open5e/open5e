**Languages** Aquan, Common, Giant

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

**Amphibious**: The hag can breathe air and water.

**Horrific
Appearance**: Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the
hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving
throw. On a failed save, the creature is :ref:`srd:frightened` for 1 minute. A
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect
on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or
the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific
Appearance for the next 24 hours. Unless the target is surprised or the
revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its
eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its
next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack
rolls against the hag.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Claws**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**Death Glare**: The hag targets
one :ref:`srd:frightened` creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target
can see the hag, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against
this magic or drop to 0 hit points.

**Illusory Appearance**: The hag
covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical
illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size
and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to
end it or if she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold
up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no
claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a
creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and
succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that
the hag is disguised.
