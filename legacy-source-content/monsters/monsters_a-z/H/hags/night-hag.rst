Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Claws (Hag Form Only)**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. *Hit*: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

**Change Shape**:
The hag magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium female humanoid, or
back into her true form. Her statistics are the same in each form. Any
equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to
her true form if she dies.

**Etherealness**: The hag magically enters
the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. To do so, the
hag must have a *heartstone* in her possession.

**Nightmare Haunting
(1/Day)**: While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a
sleeping humanoid on the Material Plane. A :ref:`srd:protection-from-evil-and-good` spell cast on the target prevents this contact, as does a :ref:`srd:magic-circle`. As long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful
visions. If these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no
benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5 (1d10).
If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target
dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is trapped in the hag's *soul
bag*. The reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until
removed by the :ref:`srd:greater-restoration` spell or similar magic.
