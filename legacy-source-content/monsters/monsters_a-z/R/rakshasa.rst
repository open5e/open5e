Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The rakshasa makes two claw attacks.

**Claw**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 9 (2d6 + 2)
slashing damage, and the target is cursed if it is a creature. The
magical curse takes effect whenever the target takes a short or long
rest, filling the target's thoughts with horrible images and dreams. The
cursed target gains no benefit from finishing a short or long rest. The
curse lasts until it is lifted by a remove curse spell or similar magic.
