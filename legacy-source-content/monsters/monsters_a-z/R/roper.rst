**False Appearance**: While the roper remains motionless, it is
indistinguishable from a normal cave formation, such as a stalagmite.

**Grasping Tendrils**: The roper can have up to six tendrils at a time.
Each tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison
and psychic damage). Destroying a tendril deals no damage to the roper,
which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn. A tendril can
also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 15
Strength check against it.

**Spider Climb**: The roper can climb
difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing
to make an ability check.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The roper makes four attacks with its tendrils, uses
Reel, and makes one attack with its bite.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon
Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 22 (4d8 + 4)
piercing damage.

**Tendril**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 50
ft., one creature. *Hit*: The target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 15). Until
the grapple ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained` and has disadvantage on
Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and the roper can't use the
same tendril on another target.

**Reel**: The roper pulls each creature
:ref:`srd:grappled` by it up to 25 feet straight toward it.
