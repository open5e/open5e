Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 40 (6d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage. If the
target is a creature, it is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 17). Until this grapple
ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained`, and the remorhaz can't bite another
target.

**Swallow**: The remorhaz makes one bite attack against a Medium
or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature
takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While
swallowed, the creature is :ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`, it has total cover
against attacks and other effects outside the remorhaz, and it takes 21
(6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the remorhaz's turns. If the
remorhaz takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside
it, the remorhaz must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at
the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall
:ref:`srd:prone` in a space within 10 feet of the remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a
swallowed creature is no longer :ref:`srd:restrained` by it and can escape from the
corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting :ref:`srd:prone`.
