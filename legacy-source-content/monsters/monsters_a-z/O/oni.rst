Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The oni makes two attacks, either with its claws or its
glaive.

**Claw (Oni Form Only)**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.

**Glaive**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 15
(2d10 + 4) slashing damage, or 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage in Small or
Medium form.

**Change Shape**: The oni magically polymorphs into a Small
or Medium humanoid, into a Large giant, or back into its true form.
Other than its size, its statistics are the same in each form. The only
equipment that is transformed is its glaive, which shrinks so that it
can be wielded in humanoid form. If the oni dies, it reverts to its true
form, and its glaive reverts to its normal size.
