Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The otyugh makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its tentacles.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. If the
target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw against disease or become :ref:`srd:poisoned` until the disease is cured.
Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw,
reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is
cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point
maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts
until the disease is cured.

**Tentacle**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to
hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage
plus 4 (1d8) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is
:ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 13) and :ref:`srd:restrained` until the grapple ends. The
otyugh has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.


**Tentacle Slam**: The otyugh slams creatures :ref:`srd:grappled` by it into each
other or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw or take 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and be
:ref:`srd:stunned` until the end of the otyugh's next turn. On a successful save,
the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't :ref:`srd:stunned`.
