**Ooze Cube**: The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can
enter the space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's
Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw. Creatures inside the
cube can be seen but have total cover. A creature within 5 feet of the
cube can take an action to pull a creature or object out of the cube.
Doing so requires a successful DC 12 Strength check, and the creature
making the attempt takes 10 (3d6) acid damage. The cube can hold only
one Large creature or up to four Medium or smaller creatures inside it
at a time.

**Transparent**: Even when the cube is in plain sight, it
takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to spot a cube that
has neither moved nor attacked. A creature that tries to enter the
cube's space while unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Pseudopod**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature. *Hit*: 10 (3d6) acid damage.

**Engulf**: The cube moves up to
its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large or smaller creatures'
spaces. Whenever the cube enters a creature's space, the creature must
make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature
can choose to be pushed 5 feet back or to the side of the cube. A
creature that chooses not to be pushed suffers the consequences of a
failed saving throw. On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's
space, and the creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The
engulfed creature can't breathe, is :ref:`srd:restrained`, and takes 21 (6d6) acid
damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube moves,
the engulfed creature moves with it. An engulfed creature can try to
escape by taking an action to make a DC 12 Strength check. On a success,
the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of
the cube.
