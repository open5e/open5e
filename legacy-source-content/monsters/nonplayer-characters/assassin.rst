**Assassinate**: During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on
attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the
assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

**Evasion**: If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to
make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin
instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only
half damage if it fails.

**Sneak Attack**: Once per turn, the assassin
deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon
attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is
within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn't :ref:`srd:incapacitated` and
the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The assassin makes two shortsword attacks.

**Shortsword**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a
DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Light Crossbow**: *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a
DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Trained in the use of poison, **assassins** are remorseless killers who
work for nobles, guildmasters, sovereigns, and anyone else who can
afford them.
