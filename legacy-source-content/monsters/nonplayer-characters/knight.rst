Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The knight makes two melee attacks.

**Greatsword**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 10
(2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**Heavy Crossbow**: *Ranged Weapon Attack*:
+2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit*: 5 (1d10) piercing
damage.

**Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**: For 1
minute, the knight can utter a special command or warning whenever a
nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack
roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided
it can hear and understand the knight. A creature can benefit from only
one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the knight is
:ref:`srd:incapacitated`.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Parry**: The knight adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that
would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding
a melee weapon.

Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and
noble causes. A knight's alignment determines the extent to which a
pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a
knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and
hirelings who are commoners.
