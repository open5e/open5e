Sand Spider
-----------

*When a sand spider attacks, its two speckled, tan legs erupt from the
sand, plunging forward with murderous speed, followed by a spider
the size of a horse. They attack as often in broad daylight as at night.*

**Drag Prey into Tunnels.** Sand spiders lurk beneath the arid
plains and dry grasslands. These carnivores hunt desert dwellers
and plains travelers by burrowing into loose sand so they are
completely hidden from view. When prey walks over their trap,
the spider lunges up from hiding, snares the prey, and drags it
down beneath the sand, where it can wrap the prey in webbing
before quickly stabbing it to death.

**Spider Packs.** More terrifying than a lone sand spider is a
group of sand spiders hunting together. They build connected
lair networks called clusters, containing one female and 2 or
3 males. They work together with one sand spider attacking to
draw attention, and 2 or 3 others attacking from trapdoors in the
opposite direction, behind the skirmish line.

on attack rolls against surprised targets.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The sand spider makes two
attacks with its impaling legs and one
bite attack.

**Impaling Leg.** *Melee Weapon Attack:*
+8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (1d12 + 5) piercing damage.
If the sand spider scores a critical hit
with this attack, it rolls damage dice
three times instead of twice. If both
impaling leg attacks hit the same
target, the second hit does an extra 11
(1d12 + 5) piercing damage.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) poison
damage, or half as much poison damage with a successful DC
13 Constitution saving throw.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Trapdoor Ambush.** When a creature walks over a sand spider’s
hidden burrow, the spider can use its reaction to attack
that creature with two impaling leg attacks. The creature is
considered a surprised target for both attacks. If one or both
attacks hit and the target is a Medium or smaller creature, then
the sand spider and the target engage in a Strength contest.
If the creature wins, it can immediately move 5 feet away from
the sand spider. If the contest results in a tie, the creature is
:ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 15). If the sand spider wins, the creature
is :ref:`srd:grappled` and dragged by the sand spider 30 feet into its lair.
If the creature is still grappled at the start of the sand spider’s
next turn, it becomes :ref:`srd:restrained` instead. The restrained
creature can escape by using an action to make a successful
DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
