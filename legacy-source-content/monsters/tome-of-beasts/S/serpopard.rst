Serpopard
---------

*These spotted and scaly quadrupeds run on hairless leonine paws,
while their cat heads perch atop sinuous, serpentine necks.*

**Swaying, Snakelike Cats.** Serpopards are 13 feet long and
weigh 600 lb, with little gender dimorphism. They have feline
bodies but long, serpentine necks topped by vaguely draconic
heads. Their hairless paws have wickedly curved, retractable
talons. A serpopard’s neck is in constant motion, swaying like
a cobra, allowing it to track foes on all sides and to strike in
unexpected directions.

**Easily Distracted.** Serpopards are foul-tempered predators
and scavengers, and are known to occasionally resort to
cannibalizing their weakest pack mate. They actively hunt
humanoids when possible and also attack other predators to
steal their kills—or to kill and eat the predators, then take their
kills. Serpopards are not tenacious hunters, however. They can
be distracted from a pursuit by the appearance of an easier meal.

**Musk Glands.** In some culture, serpopard pelts and musk
glands are prized for use in fashion and perfumes. Images
of these odd animals appear regularly in southern tomb
iconography and temple decoration.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The serpopard makes two
bite attacks and two claw attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit,
reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3)
piercing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage.

**Musk (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** The serpopard
releases a jet of foul-smelling musk in a 15-foot cone that
lasts for 2d4 rounds. Creatures in the cone must make DC
13 Dexterity saving throws. If the save succeeds, the creature
moves to the nearest empty space outside the cone; if the
saving throw fails, the creature becomes drenched in musk.
A creature that enters the area of the cone while the musk
persists is saturated automatically. A creature saturated in
musk is :ref:`srd:poisoned`. In addition, every creature that starts its turn
within 5 feet of a saturated creature must make a successful
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`srd:poisoned` until the start
of its next turn. Serpopard musk (and the poisoning) wear off
naturally in 1d4 hours. A saturated creature can end the effect
early by spending 20 minutes thoroughly washing itself, its
clothes, and its equipment with water and soap.
