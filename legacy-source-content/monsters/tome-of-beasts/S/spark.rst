Spark
-----

*This mote of electrical energy floats menacingly, erupting in
a shower of sparks and tendrils of lightning. When it
disappears, it leaves only the whiff of ozone.*

**Born in Storms.** When a great storm rips
across a world in the Material Plane, it
sometimes tears loose the fabric of reality,
releasing sentient creatures composed
entirely of elemental energy. Fueled by
its frenetic thought patterns and erratic
actions, a spark jolts through its new
world to find a physical body, drawn by
an urge to know form.

**Symbionts and Twins.** Some
spellcasters deliberately seek out sparks
for symbiosis. Sorcerers or clerics devoted
to deities of the elements may reach an
agreement with these creatures, allowing
them to ride within their bodies for their
entire lifetime.

Occasionally when a spark forms, an oppositely
charged mate is created at the same time. When this
happens, the two always stay within 300 feet of one another.
Sparks rarely survive longer than a year, even within a symbiotic
relationship with a mortal form. When they expire, they simply
wink out and return to the elemental planes.

**Seek Strong Hosts.** When a formless spark senses a
potential body approaching, it dims its light or enters a metallic
object. Sparks prefer to inhabit creatures with high Strength
over other possible targets. Once in control of a body, the spark
uses the new vessel to deliver :ref:`srd:shocking-grasp` attacks or to cast
:ref:`srd:lightning-bolt` or :ref:`srd:call-lightning` against distant enemies. If ejected
from a creature, a spark immediately tries to inhabit another.

**Elemental Nature.** A spark doesn’t require air, food, drink,
or sleep.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The spark’s innate casting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). It
can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material
components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:shocking-grasp`

**3/day:** :ref:`srd:lightning-bolt`

**1/day:** :ref:`srd:call-lightning`

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Inhabit.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* The target must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving
throw or become dominated by the spark, as the :ref:`srd:dominate-person` spell. The spark instantly enters the target’s space
and merges into the target’s physical form. While inhabiting
a creature, a spark takes no damage from physical attacks.
The target creature receives a +4 bonus to its Dexterity and
Charisma scores while it’s inhabited. The speech and actions
of an inhabited creature are noticeably jerky and erratic to any
creature with passive Perception 14 or higher.

Each time the spark uses innate spellcasting, the host can
attempt another DC 14 Charisma saving throw. A successful
save expels the spark, which appears in an unoccupied space
within 5 feet of the former host.

The inhabiting spark slowly burns out its host’s nervous
system. The inhabited creature must make a successful DC 15
Constitution saving throw at the end of each 24 hour-period
or take 2d6 lightning damage and have its maximum hit
points reduced by the same amount. The creature dies if this
damage reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction
lasts until the inhabited creature completes a long rest after
the spark is expelled.
