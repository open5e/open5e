Star-Spawn of Cthulhu
---------------------

*The star-dwelling, octopoid servants and children of Cthulhu are
enormous and strange, with clawed hands, powerful but distended
brains, and winglike spines on their backs, with which they propel
themselves through the frozen emptiness between stars.*

These masters of psychic communication and dimensional
manipulation can transport themselves and others across
enormous distances.

**Mastery of Life and Destruction.** They’ve harnessed
mysterious energies of life and destruction as well, to grow new
life with remarkable speed (and some degree of wastage and
cancerous tumors) and to turn living flesh into miasmic vapor
through nothing more than focused attention.

**Rituals to Cthulhu.** Their goals are simple: oppose the
mi-go and aid dread Cthulhu. The star-spawn destroy creatures
that will not yield and serve as slaves and sacrifices, rather than
allowing them to serve another master. Above all, they insist
that all creatures venerate great Cthulhu and sacrifice life and
treasure in his name. Their ultimate aim is to bend the heavens
themselves and ensure that the stars are rightly positioned in
their orbits to herald Cthulhu’s inevitable return.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The star spawn can use disintegrating gaze if it’s
available, and also make one claws attack and one dimensional
stomp attack.

**Crushing Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack.* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 20 (2d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 13
(3d8) necrotic damage.

**Disintegrating Gaze (Recharge 5-6).** Ranged Spell Attack: +15
to hit, range 60 ft., one target in line of sight. *Hit:* 32 (5d12)
necrotic damage, and the target must make a successful DC 20
Constitution saving throw or dissipate into vapor as if affected
by a :ref:`srd:gaseous-form` spell. An affected creature repeats the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns; on a success, the
effect ends on that creature, but on a failure, the creature takes
another 32 (5d12) necrotic damage and remains gaseous. ‘A
creature reduced to 0 hit points by this necrotic damage is
permanently disintegrated and can be restored only by a :ref:`srd:wish`
or comparable magic that doesn’t require some portion of a
corpse to work.

**Dimensional Stomp.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (2d20 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the
target must make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or
be teleported to a new location as if affected by the :ref:`srd:dimension-door` spell. The destination is chosen by the star spawn, but it
cannot be in the same space as another object or creature.
