Shadow Beast
------------

*A mass of shadows and cloudstuff, never touching the ground, a
shadow beast may at first look harmless—except for its clawed
hands and the glint of its jagged teeth.*

**Called from the Void.** Shadow beasts are thought to be the
result of shadow fey dabbling in the magic of the void. Almost
shapeless and largely incorporeal, through an act of will they can
form rough semblances of their old bodies when needed.

**Hate the Past.** The motivations of these creatures
are inscrutable. They despise light and anything that
reminds them of light or of their former existence.
Beyond that, little is understood about them.

**Cryptic Messages.** Shadow beasts are seldom
found in groups, but when they are, they seem to have
no difficulty or reluctance about operating and fighting
together. They have been known to deliver cryptic and
threatening messages, but speaking is difficult for them. At
times, they perform arcane rituals with the aid of evil humanoids
and the use of dark materials. In these rituals they sacrifice
magical energies and life blood as well as the tears of innocents
and the souls of the damned.
