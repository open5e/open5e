Son of Fenris
-------------

*The dread sons of Fenris are hideously strong
and dangerous in their mastery of the
arcane. Their acidic breath stinks of
death, and they move with a menacing
grace. Eldritch blood runs in their veins.*

**Demonic Wolves.**
Demonic black eyes, two
snakelike tongues, and
green-black scales beneath their thick black
fur betray their unnatural origins. Although
the sons of Fenris are powerful spellcasters, they
prefer physical violence, using their spells
only if faced with foes they cannot simply
tear apart.

**Hibernate Until Ravenous.** Sons of Fenris are creatures
of hunger, rage, and madness. They can subsist on infrequent
gorging, so they slumber beneath the snow for weeks or months,
waking when they grow ravenous or when prey approaches close
enough to smell. When hunting, they revel in wanton savagery
and destruction, killing entire flocks or herds to delight in blood
and to cast runes among the entrails.

**Desperate Worshipers.** Despite their fierce nature, all the
sons of Fenris are wise in divine lore, and desperate souls offer
them worship and sacrifice in exchange for aid. The sons of
Fenris enjoy this adulation, and provide protection, meat, and
wisdom to their followers. In some cases, they gather enormous
war bands over winter and going reaving in the spring.

of Fenris can make another slam attack against it as a bonus
action.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The son of Fenris makes one bite attack and one
slam attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) poison
damage, and the target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 18). If the
target was already grappled, it is swallowed instead. While
swallowed, the target is :ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`, it has total
cover against attacks and other effects from outside the
son of Fenris, and it takes 28 (8d6) acid damage at the start
of each of the son of Fenris’s turns. It can swallow only one
creature at a time. If it takes 45 damage or more on a single
turn from the swallowed creature, it must succeed on a DC 17
Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate
the creature, which falls :ref:`srd:prone` in a space within 10 feet of the
son of Fenris. If the son of Fenris dies, a swallowed creature is
no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by
using 15 feet of movement, exiting :ref:`srd:prone`.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

**Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The son of Fenris exhales acid in a
60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line takes
45 (10d8) acid damage, or half damage with a successful DC
18 Dexterity saving throw.
