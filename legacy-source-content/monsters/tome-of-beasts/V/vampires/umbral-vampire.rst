Umbral Vampire
--------------

*An umbral vampire is a fiendish creature, once human but twisted
into a dark reflection by an ancient curse. It resembles a deathly
pale, gaunt human with stringy hair, dressed in scant rags. Misty
strands of darkness leak from its empty eye sockets, yawning nasal
cavity, and mouth.*

**Cursed Origin.** Legends speak of an ancient city whose
origins are lost to the ages, where a cabal of wizards with
the power to manipulate the flow of time made its citizens
immortal. When the wizards fell and no longer held back the
ravages of time, the citizens aged centuries in moments. Instead
of dying, the wretches lingered on in their dark realm.

**Bound to Darkness.** All umbral vampires originate from
a single location, and under most circumstances, they’re
encountered only in that forsaken place. Despite the terrors it
holds, adventurers continue to seek out the area, chasing legends
of potent artifacts and boundless treasure accumulated during
its golden age. Occasionally, an umbral vampire slips into the
mortal world, where it hides in a place seldom or never touched
by sunlight and emerges at night to search for victims.

**Shadowy Nature.** An umbral vampire doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:mirror-image`, :ref:`srd:plane-shift` (plane
of shadows only)

vampire can Hide as a bonus action, even while being
observed.

**Strike from Shadow.** The reach of the umbral vampire’s umbral
grasp attack increases by 10 feet and its damage increases
by 4d6 when both the umbral vampire and the target of the
attack are in dim light or darkness and the umbral vampire is
hidden from its target.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in direct sunlight, the umbral
vampire has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Umbral Grasp.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 18 (4d6 + 4) cold damage and the target’s Strength
score is reduced by 1d6. The target dies if this reduces its
Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target
finishes a short or long rest.

If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a :ref:`srd:shadow` rises
from the corpse 1d4 hours later.
