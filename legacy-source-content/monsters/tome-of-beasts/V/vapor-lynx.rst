Vapor Lynx
----------

*These great cats pad noiselessly, while tendrils of smoke drift off
their sleek gray coats, leaving misty whorls in their wake. Their
eyes shift from dull, pallid orbs to pitch black slits. Their lips curl up
into a fang-revealing smile as their bodies fades into fog.*

**Split the Herd.** Vapor lynxes are capricious hunters.
Devious, manipulative, and mischievous, they toy with their
prey before killing it. They rarely enjoy a stand-up fight, instead
coalescing in and out of the fog to harass victims. Using their
ability to solidify and poison the fog around them, they cut large
groups into smaller, more manageable morsels.

**Dreary Marshlands.** Their tactics have earned vapor
lynxes a nasty reputation and the occasional bounty on their
heads. Additionally, their magical nature makes them valuable
to practitioners of the magical arts, and their beautiful, thick
coats tempt many a furrier into hunts they may not be prepared
for. For these reasons, vapor lynxes avoid civilization, fearing
organized reprisal. Instead they haunt marshes and swamps,
where the natural fog makes hunting easier. If an intelligent
humanoid passes their way, they are happy for a change in
their diet.

**Chatty with Dinner.** Although reclusive, vapor
lynxes are intelligent, speaking both Common and
Sylvan. They are particularly prideful and take great joy
in bantering with potential meals to belittle and frighten them.
Survivors of vapor lynx encounters invariably mention their
constant needling and self-aggrandizement.

**Smoky Constitution.** The vapor lynx spends its time in both
gaseous and solid form. Its unique constitution makes it

its own. A vapor lynx sees clearly through light or heavy
obscurement caused by fog, mist, or spells such as fog cloud.

**Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The vapor lynx exhales a 40-foot

area around the lynx. Any breathing creature that ends its turn
in the fog must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or
become :ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1d4 + 1 rounds.
