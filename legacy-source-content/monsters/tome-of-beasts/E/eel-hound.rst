Eel Hound
---------

*A grotesque beast with the muscular tail, bulbous
head, and the rubbery, slime-covered flesh of a
hideous eel, the torso and webbed paws of this
amphibious predator resemble those of a misshapen
canine. Needle-sharp teeth fill the creature’s
menacing jaws.*

**Hounds of the River Fey.** Ferocious
aquatic fey, these amphibious menaces often
serve such masters as lake and river trolls,
lorelei, and nixies. Predatory beasts as
dangerous on land as they are in the water,
they share their masters’ capricious cruelty.
The hounds’ chilling hunting cries inspire
their masters to a killing frenzy as they pursue
foes. Few other creatures appreciate eel
hounds’ lithe power and cruel grace, instead
noting only their grotesque form and
unnerving savagery.

**Slippery Ambushers.** Eel hounds are
ambush predators, preferring to hide
among the muck and algae of riverbanks,
only to suddenly burst forth as a pack. They
surround their prey, latching on with their
powerful jaws. Non-aquatic prey are dragged
into the depths to drown. Similarly, eel hounds often force
aquatic prey up onto dry land to die of suffocation.

Possessed of a low cunning, they prepare ambushes by
vomiting forth their slippery spittle where land animals come
to drink or along game trails. They surge out of the water to
snatch prey while it is off balance.

**Liquid Speech.** Eel hounds understand Sylvan, and those
dwelling near humans or other races pick up a few words in
other tongues.
