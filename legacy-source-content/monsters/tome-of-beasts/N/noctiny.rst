Noctiny
-------

*A grinning man brandishes a staff surmounted by a rune-covered
skull. Blasphemous sigils adorn his clothes, and ashes stain his
skin a sickly gray.*

Noctiny are wretched humanoids corrupted by fell power.
Their skin is sallow and gaunt even before they smear it
with ash, bone dust, and worse materials to wash all living
color from their bodies. The noctiny embrace all manner of
blasphemous and taboo behaviors to please their masters.

**Pyramid of Power.** The noctiny’s lust for power drives
them away from decency and reason. They are initiates who
form the lowest rung of fext society. They swear themselves
into service to the undead :ref:`tob:fext` as thugs, servants, acolytes,
and cannon fodder, and in exchange draw a trickle of
power for themselves.

**A Race Apart.** Though they arise from any
humanoid stock, the noctiny are corrupted
by the powers they serve. Noctiny retain the
cosmetic traits that identify their original race if
one looks hard enough, but any connection they
once had to their fellows is overpowered by their
transformation into noctiny.
