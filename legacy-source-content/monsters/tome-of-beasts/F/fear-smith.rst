Fear Smith (Fiarsídhe)
----------------------

*Apart from their taloned hands and blank face, fear smiths appear
elven. While its mouth is closed, a fear smith’s face is featureless
save for rows of deep wrinkles. Opening the large mouth in the
center of its face reveals long needlelike teeth surrounding a single
massive eye.*

Known as a fiarsídhe among themselves, fear smiths are servants
of the Court of the Shadow Fey and similar dark fey courts of
such as those of Queen Mab and the Snow Queen.

**Icy-Cold Eyes.** Fear smiths often serve as torturers or are
dispatched to demoralize the court’s enemies. Their stare stops
enemies cold, making it easy for heavily-armed warriors to trap
and finish a foe.

**Devour Fear.** As their nickname suggests, fear smiths feed off
strong emotions, and their favorite meal is terror. The fey prefer
prolonging the death of victims, and, when free to indulge, a fear
smith stalks its victim for days before attacking, hinting at its
presence to build dread.

**Hoods and Masks.** Fear smiths favor fine clothing and high
fashion, donning hooded cloaks or masks when discretion is
required. Eerily well-mannered and respectful, fear smiths enjoy
feigning civility and playing the part of nobility, speaking genteelly
but with a thick, unidentifiable accent from within a cowl.

**Distortion Gaze.** Those who meet the gaze of the fear smith
experience the world seeming to twist at unnatural angles
beneath their feet. When a creature that can see the fear
smith’s eye starts its turn within 30 feet of the fear smith, the
creature must make a successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throw
or become disoriented. While disoriented, the creature falls
:ref:`srd:prone` each time it tries to move or take the Dash or Disengage
action. To recover from disorientation, a creature must start its
turn outside the fear smith’s gaze and make a successful DC 16
Wisdom saving throw.

To use this ability, the fear smith can’t be incapacitated and
must see the affected creature. A creature that isn’t surprised
can avert its eyes at the start of its turn to avoid the effect. In
that case, no saving
throw is necessary
but the creature
treats the fear smith as
:ref:`srd:invisible` until the start
of the creature’s next
turn. If during its
turn the creature
chooses to look at
the fear smith, it must
immediately make the saving throw.

**Hidden Eye.** The fear smith has advantage on
saving throws against the blinded condition.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The fear smith’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 16). The fear smith can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no verbal or material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:detect-thoughts`, :ref:`srd:fear`

**2/day each:** :ref:`srd:charm-person`, :ref:`srd:command`, :ref:`srd:confusion`

**Magic Resistance.** The fear smith has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The fear smith makes three claw attacks.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., 1 creature.
*Hit:* 16 (2d12 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is disoriented
by Distortion Gaze, this attack does an additional 13 (3d8)
psychic damage and heals the fear smith by an equal amount.

**Heartstopping Stare.** The fear smith terrifies a creature within 30
feet with a look. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom
saving throw or be :ref:`srd:stunned` for 1 round and take 13 (3d8)
psychic damage and heal the fear smith by an equal amount.
