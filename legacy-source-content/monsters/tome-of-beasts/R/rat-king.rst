Rat King
--------

*A great knot of scabrous rats scrabbles together as a mass, with
skulls, bones, and flesh entangled in the whole. Teeth, eyes, and
fur all flow as a single disturbing rat swarm walking on two legs.*

**Fused at the Tail.** A rat king forms when dozens of rats
twist their tails together in a thick knot of bone and
lumpy cartilage—and offer praise to the rat demon
Chittr'k'k. Its numbers and powers grow quickly.

**Rule Sewers and Slums.** The rat king is a cunning
creature that stalks city sewers, boneyards, and
slums. Some even command entire thieves’ guilds
or hordes of beggars that give it obeisance. They grow
larger and more powerful over time until discovered.

**Plague and Dark Magic.** The rat king is the result
of plague infused with twisted magic, and a malignant
ceremony that creates one is called “Enthroning
the Rat King.” Rats afflicted with virulent leavings
of dark magic rites or twisted experiments become
bound to one another. As more rats add to the
mass, the creature’s intelligence and force of will
grow, and it invariably goes quite mad.

**Keen Smell.** The rat king has advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on smell.

**Plague of Ill Omen.** The rat king radiates a magical aura of
misfortune in a 30-foot radius. A foe of the rat king that starts
its turn in the aura must make a successful DC 14 Charisma
saving throw or be cursed with bad luck until the start of its
next turn. When a cursed character makes an attack roll, ability
check, or saving throw, it must subtract 1d4 from the result.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The rat king makes four bite attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and a bitten creature
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be
infected with a disease. A diseased creature gains one level of
:ref:`srd:exhaustion` immediately. When the creature finishes a long rest,
it must repeat the saving throw. On a failure, the creature gains
another level of exhaustion. On a success, the disease does not
progress. The creature recovers from the disease if its saving
throw succeeds after two consecutive long rests or if it receives
a :ref:`srd:lesser-restoration` spell or comparable magic. The creature
then recovers from one level of exhaustion after each long rest.

**Summon Swarm (1/Day).** The rat king summons three swarms
of rats. The swarms appear immediately within 60 feet of
the rat king. They can appear in spaces occupied by other
creatures. The swarms act as allies of the rat king. They remain
for 1 hour or until the rat king dies.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Absorption.** When the rat king does damage to a rat or rat
swarm, it can absorb the rat, or part of the swarm, into its own
mass. The rat king regains hit points equal to the damage it
did to the rat or swarm.
