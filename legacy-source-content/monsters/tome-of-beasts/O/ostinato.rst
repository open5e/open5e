Ostinato
--------

*A bit of catchy, repetitive music emanates from nowhere, drifting
and moving as if dancing in the empty air.*

**Born from Drama.** Incredibly moving arias, passionate
performances, and ditties that drive you mad are often the
product of ostinatos. These creatures of living music are born
from overwrought emotions, and they feed off the vitality and
personality of mortals.

**Song Searchers.** Ostinatos wander the mortal world as
repetitive snippets of song, searching for hosts and rich feeding
grounds. They enter hosts secretly, remaining undetected to
prolong their voracious feasting as long as possible.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The ostinato makes two cacophony ray attacks.

**Cacophony Ray.** Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 60 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) thunder damage.

**Aural Symbiosis (1/Day).** One humanoid that the ostinato
can see within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma
saving throw or the ostinato merges with it, becoming an
enjoyable, repetitive tune in its host’s mind. The ostinato can’t
be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect. The target
retains control of its body and is aware of the ostinato’s
presence only as a melody, not as a living entity. The target
no longer needs to eat or drink, gains the ostinato’s Magic
Resistance trait, and has advantage on Charisma checks. It
also has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and it can’t
maintain concentration on spells or other effects for more than
a single turn. The target can make a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight)
check once every 24 hours; on a success, it realizes that the
music it hears comes from an external entity.
The Aural Symbiosis lasts until the target drops to 0 hit
points, the ostinato ends it as a bonus action, or the ostinato
is forced out by a :ref:`srd:dispel-evil-and-good` spell or comparable
magic. When the Aural Symbiosis ends, the ostinato bursts
forth in a thunderous explosion of sound and reappears in
an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the target. All creatures
within 60 feet, including the original target, take 21 (6d6)
thunder damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13
Constitution saving throw. The target becomes immune to this
ostinato’s Aural Symbiosis for 24 hours if it succeeds on the
saving throw or after the Aural Symbiosis ends.

**Voracious Aura (1/Day).** While merged with a humanoid
(see Aural Symbiosis), the ostinato feeds on nearby creatures.
Up to nine creatures of the ostinato’s choice within 60 feet
of it can be targeted. Each target must succeed on a DC 13
Charisma saving throw or take 3 (1d6) necrotic damage and
have its hit point maximum reduced by the same amount until
it finishes a long rest. The target dies if its maximum hit points
are reduced to 0. Victims notice this damage immediately, but
not its source.
