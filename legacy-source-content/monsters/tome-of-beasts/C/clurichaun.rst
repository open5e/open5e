Clurichaun
----------

*Around a corner in the wine cellar stumbles a surly, two-foot tall
man carrying an open bottle of wine. He has a bushy beard and
wears a rumpled, red overcoat over a dirty white shirt and knee-length
red trousers with blue stockings and silver-buckled shoes. A
cap made from leaves stitched together with gold thread slouches
atop his head, and he reeks of stale beer and wine.*

**Drunks in the Cellar.** Clurichauns are mean-spirited,
alcohol-loving fey that plague butteries and wine cellars. These
drunken fey were once leprechauns, but they long ago forsook a
life of toil for one of solitary debauchery. Now they spend every
night drinking, warbling off-key, and tormenting their hapless
hosts with cruel pranks.

However, if the clurichaun’s host keeps him or her well
supplied with a favorite libation and otherwise leaves him or her
alone, the clurichaun will protect their wine cellars from thieves,
drunkards, or worse—becoming quite vigorous when they feel
the security of the cellars is threatened in any way. They have a
particular hatred for :ref:`rum gremlins <tob:rum-gremlin>` and for other clurichauns.

**Contest Evictions.** Most people can’t tolerate or afford
a clurichaun’s presence for long. Unfortunately, attempts to
drive them off usually result in the spiteful clurichaun going on
a destructive rampage and them spoiling any remaining wine.
The best way to evict a clurichaun is to challenge him or her to a
drinking contest. A clurichaun can’t abide losing to a mortal and
will slink away in shame, never to be seen again, if that happens.
This is a risky option, however, because despite their size,
clurichauns can drink prodigiously with little ill effect.

**Small Brawlers.** While clurichauns aren’t adverse to an
old-fashioned tavern brawl, they rely mainly on their magic to
protect themselves. Creatures under a clurichaun’s spell feel
and act as if they were intoxicated, complete with hangovers the
next morning!
