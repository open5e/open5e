Azza Gremlin
------------

*These tiny, hairless, rail-thin creatures crackle with static
electricity. Arcs of lightning snap between their long ears.*

**Lightning Lovers.** Azza gremlins live among storm clouds,
lightning-based machinery, and other places with an abundance
of lightning.

**Magnetic Flight.** Although wingless, their light bodies
are perfectly attuned to electromagnetic fields, giving them
buoyancy and flight. They love playing in thunderstorms and
riding lightning bolts between the clouds or between clouds and
the ground. They feed off lightning and love to see its effects on
other creatures.

**Work with Spellcasters.** Although they aren’t much more
than hazardous pests by themselves, more malicious creatures
and spellcasters that use lightning as a weapon work with azza
gremlins to amplify their own destructiveness.
Azza gremlins stand 12 to 18 inches tall and weigh approximately
8 lb.

**Contagious Lightning.** A creature that touches the azza
gremlin or hits it with a melee attack using a metal weapon
receives a discharge of lightning. The creature must succeed
on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or attract lightning
for 1 minute. For the duration, attacks that cause lightning
damage have advantage against this creature, the creature has
disadvantage on saving throws against lightning damage and
lightning effects, and if the creature takes lightning damage, it
is :ref:`srd:paralyzed` until the end of its next turn. An affected creature
repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending
the effect on itself on a success.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Lightning Jolt.** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5
ft. or range 30 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 3 (1d6) lightning damage,
and the target is affected by Contagious Lightning.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Ride the Bolt.** The azza gremlin can travel instantly along any
bolt of lightning. When it is within 5 feet of a lightning effect,
the azza can teleport to any unoccupied space inside or within
5 feet of that lightning effect.
