Asanbosam
---------

*An asasonbosam is a hirsute hulk with bulging, bloodshot eyes,
often perched high in a tree and ready to seize unwary passersby
with talons like rusty hooks.*

**Iron Hooks and Fangs.** They resemble hairy ogres from the
waist up, but with muscular and flexible legs much longer than
those of an ogre. These odd appendages end in
feet with hooklike talons, and both the creature’s
hooks and its fangs are composed of iron rather
than bone or other organic material. These iron
fangs and claws mark an asanbosam’s age, not
just by their size but also by their color. The
youngest specimens have shiny gray hooks
and fangs, while older ones have discolored
and rusty ones.

**Iron Eaters.** The asanbosam diet includes
iron in red meat, poultry, fish, and leaf
vegetables, and—in times of desperation—
grinding iron filings off their own hooks to slake
their cravings. The asanbosams’ taste for fresh
blood and humanoid flesh led to the folklore that
they are vampiric (not true).

**Tree Lairs.** Asanbosams spend most of their
lives in trees, where they build nestlike houses or
platforms of rope and rough planks. They don’t fear
magic; most tribes count at least one spellcaster among its
members.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The asanbosam makes one bite
attack and one claws attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach
5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing
damage. If the target is a creature, it must
succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw against disease.
If the saving throw fails, the target takes 11 (2d10) poison
damage immediately and becomes :ref:`srd:poisoned` until the disease
is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the creature must repeat
the saving throw and reduce its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10)
on a failure. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The
creature dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 20 (3d10 + 4) piercing damage, and the target is :ref:`srd:grappled`
(escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained`
and the asanbosam can’t claw a different target. If the target
is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving
throw against disease or
contract the disease
described in the bite
attack.
