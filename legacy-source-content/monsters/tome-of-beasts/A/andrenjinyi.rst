Andrenjinyi
-----------

*A gigantic, black-headed snake is over 60 feet long and sheathed in
brilliant scales, each andrenjinyi is splashed with vibrant patterns
of every imaginable color. The air around these serpents is heavy,
redolent of the quenched red desert after a torrential thunderstorm.*

Andrenjinyi are the descendants of the Rainbow Serpent, the
first and greatest spirit of the world’s beginning. The Rainbow
Serpent’s children are dichotomous nature spirits of land and
sky, sun and rain, male and female, and birth and destruction.

**Last of their Kind.** The Rainbow Serpent shed
andrenjinyi like cast-off scales during her primordial
wanderings, but she has created no more since she
ascended to the stars. While andrenjinyi are ageless
fertility spirits, they cannot themselves reproduce;
each one is an irreplaceable link to primeval creation.

**Hunt and Transform.** Andrenjinyi are naturally
aquatic, preferring to live in deep, fresh, life-giving
rivers and lakes. The serpents usually attack
intruders unless they approach with the correct
rites or offerings, which require a successful DC
20 Intelligence (Religion) check.

Andrenjinyi hunt as other animals do, but they
transform devoured prey into unique species with
their Transmuting Gullet ability, creating mixed
gender pairs. An andrenjinyi’s sacred pool and
surroundings often shelters a menagerie of
strange and beautiful animals.

**Demand Obedience and Ritual.** When offered rituals and
obedience, andrenjinyi sometimes protect nearby communities
with drought-breaking rains, cures for afflictions, or the
destruction of rivals. Revered andrenjinyi take offense when
their petitioners break fertility and familial edicts, such as
prohibitions on incest, rape, and matricide, but also obscure
obligations including soothing crying infants and the ritual
sacrifice of menstrual blood. Punishments are malevolently
disproportionate, often inflicted on the whole community
and including baking drought, flooding rains, petrification,
pestilence, and animalistic violence. Thus, tying a community’s
well-being to an andrenjinyi is a double-edged sword.

**Amphibious.** The andrenjinyi can breathe air and water.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The andrenjinyi’s spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). It
can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal
components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:create-or-destroy-water` (Create Water only), :ref:`srd:speak-with-animals`, :ref:`srd:stone-shape`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:control-weather`, :ref:`srd:dispel-magic`, :ref:`srd:reincarnate`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:blight`, :ref:`srd:commune-with-nature`, :ref:`srd:contagion`, :ref:`srd:flesh-to-stone`, :ref:`srd:plant-growth`

**Magic Resistance.** The andrenjinyi has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The andrenjinyi’s weapon attacks are magical.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The andrenjinyi makes two attacks, one with its
bite and one with its constriction. If both attacks hit the same
target, then the target is Swallowed Whole.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage.

**Constrict.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 36 (4d12 + 10) bludgeoning damage, and the target
is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends the target is
restrained, and the andrenjinyi can’t constrict another target.

**Rainbow Arch.** The andrenjinyi can instantaneously teleport
between sources of fresh water within 1 mile as an action.
It can’t move normally or take any other action on the turn
when it uses this power. When this power is activated, a
rainbow manifests between the origin and destination, lasting
for 1 minute.

**Swallow Whole.** If the bite and constrict attacks hit the same
target in one turn, the creature is swallowed whole. The
target is :ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`, and has total cover against
attacks and other effects outside the andrenjinyi. The target
takes no damage inside the andrenjinyi. The andrenjinyi
can have three Medium-sized creatures or four Small-sized
creatures swallowed at a time. If the andrenjinyi takes 20
damage or more in a single turn from a swallowed creature,
the andrenjinyi must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving
throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed
creatures, which fall :ref:`srd:prone` in a space within 5 feet of the
andrenjinyi. If the andrenjinyi is slain, a swallowed creature is
no longer restrained by it and can escape from the andrenjinyi
by using 15 feet of movement, exiting :ref:`srd:prone`. The andrenjinyi
can regurgitate swallowed creatures as a free action.

**Transmuting Gullet.** When a creature is swallowed by an
andrenjinyi, it must make a successful DC 19 Wisdom saving
throw each round at the end of its turn or be affected by :ref:`srd:true-polymorph`
into a new form chosen by the andrenjinyi. The
effect is permanent until dispelled or ended with a :ref:`srd:wish` or
comparable magic.
