Angatra
-------

*This withered creature wrapped in gore-stained rags. They can pull
back a tattered hood to reveal glowing eyes hungry with bloodlust.*

In certain tribes, the breaking of local taboos invites terrible
retribution from ancestral spirits, especially if the transgressor
was a tribal leader or elder. The transgressor is cursed and cast
out from the tribe, and then hunted and executed.

**Bound Remains Entombed.** The body is wrapped head to
toe in lamba cloth to soothe the spirit and to bind it within the
mortal husk, then sealed in a tomb far from traditional burial
grounds so none may disturb it and its unclean spirit does not
taint the blessed dead.

**Slow Ritual Cleansing.** Each such body is visited every ten
years as the tribe performs the famadihana ritual, replacing the
lamba bindings and soothing the suffering of the ancestors.
Over generations, this ritual expiates their guilt, until
at last the once‑accursed ancestor is admitted through
the gates of the afterlife. If a spirit’s descendants
abandon their task, or if the sealed tomb is violated,
the accursed soul becomes an angatra.

**Angry Spirit.** The creature’s form becomes
animated by a powerful and malicious ancestor
spirit and undergoes a horrible metamorphosis
within its decaying cocoon. Its fingernails grow into
scabrous claws, its skin becomes hard and leathery, and
its withered form is imbued with unnatural speed and
agility. Within days, the angatra gathers strength and tears its
bindings into rags. It seeks out its descendants to to share the
torment and wrath it endured while its spirit lingered.

**Agonizing Gaze.** When a creature that can see the angatra’s
eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of the angatra, it must make a
DC 13 Charisma saving throw if the angatra isn’t incapacitated
and can see the creature. On a failed saving throw, the creature
has its pain threshold lowered, so that it becomes vulnerable
to all damage types until the end of its next turn. Unless it’s
surprised, a creature can avoid the saving throw by averting
its eyes at the start of its turn. A creature that averts its eyes
can’t see the angatra for one full round, when it chooses anew
whether to avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the
angatra in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.

**Ancestral Wrath.** The angatra immediately recognizes any
individual that is descended from its tribe. It has advantage
on attack rolls against such creatures, and those creatures
have disadvantage on saving throws against the angatra’s
traits and attacks.
