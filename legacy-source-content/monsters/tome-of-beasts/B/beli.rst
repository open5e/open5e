Beli
----

*These small, winter faeries are vicious and deadly. With
their pale skin and translucent wings, they blend perfectly
into their snowy environment; only their beady black eyes
stand out against the snow and ice.*

These malevolent ice-sprites are a plague upon the people of
snowy climates, ambushing unwary prey with icy arrows
and freezing spell-like powers.

**Servants of the North Wind.** Known as
“patzinaki” in some dialects of Dwarvish, the beli are
the servants of winter gods and venerate the north wind
as Boreas and other gods of darker aspects. They are
frequent allies with the fraughashar.

**Feast Crashers.** Beli especially delight in disrupting
feasts and making off with the holiday cakes—the least
deadly of their malicious pranks.

**Fear of Druids.** They have an irrational fear of
northern druids and their snow bear companions.

**Arctic Hunter.** Beli have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
checks and Wisdom (Perception) checks made in icy, natural
surroundings.

**Cold Regeneration.** As long as the temperature is below
freezing, the beli regains 3 hit points at the start of its turn.
If the beli takes fire damage, this trait doesn’t function at the
start of the beli’s next turn. The beli dies only if it starts its turn
with 0 hit points and it doesn’t regenerate.

**Flyby.** The beli doesn’t provoke an opportunity attack when it
flies out of an enemy’s reach.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The beli’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). It
can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material
components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:invisibility`

**3/day:** :ref:`srd:chill-touch`

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Ice Dagger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4) cold
damage.

**Icy Shortbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 80/320
ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4)
cold damage, and the target must make a successful DC
13 Constitution saving throw or gain 2 levels of :ref:`srd:exhaustion`
from the arrow’s icy chill. If the save succeeds, the target also
becomes immune to further exhaustion from beli arrows for
24 hours (but any levels of exhaustion already gained remain
in effect). A character who gains a sixth level of exhaustion
doesn’t die automatically but drops to 0 hit points and must
make death saving throws as normal. The exhaustion lasts until
the target recovers fully from the cold damage.
