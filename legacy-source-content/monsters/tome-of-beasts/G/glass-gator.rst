Glass Gator
-----------

*So called by some watermen because of its method of hunting,
the glass gator is a nearly-transparent ambush hunter. It usually
strikes from a bed of water, either stagnant or flowing. The
transparency of the creature, combined with its jet of silt and
poisonous sting, make it an effective hunter.*

**Strange Anatomy.** The body of a glass gator is most similar
to a centipede, but with four oversized forelimbs and a more
distinct head. The forelimbs are used to
attack, but they tire easily, forcing
the glass gator to use its powerful
lunge attack sparingly.
Once the glass gator gets
hold of prey, it wraps its
body around the victim and
squeezes, like a constrictor
snake. Unlike a serpent,
however, which uses
powerful muscles to crush
and suffocate its prey, the
glass gator is only trying
to bring its underbelly into
contact with the prey. The
glass gator’s belly is
lined with hundreds
of stingers that
deliver a virulent
nerve toxin.

**Transparency.** The glass gator’s transparency isn’t total. Its
digestive tract usually is visible, especially for a few hours after
it eats. The creature sometimes uses this limited visibility as
bait, making itself appear as a wriggling snake or eel. It is most
vulnerable just after eating, when it’s lethargic; if encountered
in its lair shortly after a meal, the DM may give the glass gator
disadvantage on initiative.

**Larval Form.** Subterranean variants—including some with
bioluminescence—have been reported in caverns. It’s been
postulated that the glass gator may be the larval form of a larger
creature, but what that larger creature might be is unknown.

**Transparency.** The glass gator has advantage on Dexterity
(Stealth) checks while underwater or in dim light.

**Standing Leap.** The glass gator can long jump up to 15 feet
from water or up to 10 feet on land, with or without a running

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage, and the target is :ref:`srd:grappled`
(escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained
and the glass gator can’t attack a different target.

**Constrict.** One creature that’s already grappled by the glass
gator takes 7 (2d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6)
poison damage, or half as much poison damage with a
successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Silt Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** After taking
damage while in water, the glass gator thrashes to stir up a
10-foot-radius cloud of silt around itself. The area inside the
sphere is heavily obscured for 1 minute (10 rounds) in still
water or 5 (2d4) rounds in a strong current. After stirring up
the silt, the glass gator can move its speed.
