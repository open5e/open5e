Imperial Ghoul
--------------

*An imperial ghoul stands tall and proud, its gray flesh robust and
muscled, its sharp talons stained black, and its clothing strangely
well kept. Its flickering red eyes have an intelligent, malicious
gleam.*

**Ambitious Strivers.** Many believe that the hunger cults or
the necrophagi know some secret of transforming imperial
ghouls into iron ghouls. This rumor gives them hope of
advancement. Their power over the lesser ghouls and slaves gives
them a taste of tyranny. Because they are ambitious and always
hungry for more power, imperial ghouls are eager to prove
themselves as hunters, as warriors, and as spies.

**Immune to Sun.** Unlike a standard darakhul, an imperial ghoul
does not suffer from sunlight and feels little need to disguise its
true appearance.
