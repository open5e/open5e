Gug
---

*The gugs are giants of the underworld, long since banished into
dark realms for their worship of the eldest and foulest gods.*

**Underworld Godlings.** Gugs enjoy smashing and devouring
lesser creatures, and their burbling and grunting speech displays
a surprising and malign intelligence to those few who can
understand it. Gugs are occasionally worshipped by tribes of
derro, and their strange underworld cities are filled with filled
with esoteric monoliths and constructs.

**Nocturnal Raiders.** While gugs are banished into
the underworld in mortal realms, they regularly flout this
prohibition by raiding the surface by night. They also spend
much time in the Dreamlands and the Ethereal plane; some
gug warlocks and sorcerers are said to travel the planes with
entourages of fext or noctiny.

**Prey on Ghouls.** Gugs devour ghouls and darakhul as
their preferred foodstuffs. When these are not available, they
seem to prefer carrion and particular varieties of psychotropic
mushrooms, as well as something that is best described as
candied bats.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The gug makes two slam attacks, two stomp
attacks, or one of each.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
creature. *Hit:* 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If a
creature is hit by this attack twice in the same turn, the
target must make a successful DC 19 Constitution saving
throw or gain one level of :ref:`srd:exhaustion`.

**Stomp.** *Melee Weapon Attack.* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* 20
(2d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A gug can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time
and only at the end of another creature’s turn. A gug regains
spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Move.** The gug moves up to half its speed.

**Attack.** The gug makes one slam or stomp attack.

**Grab.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* the target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 17).

**Swallow.** The gug swallows one creature it has grappled.
The creature takes 26 (3d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage
immediately plus 13 (2d12) acid damage at the start of each
of the gug’s turns. A swallowed creature is no longer grappled
but is :ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`, and has total cover against
attacks and other effects from outside the gug. If the gug
takes 75 points of damage in a single turn, the swallowed
creature is expelled and falls :ref:`srd:prone` next to the gug. When the
gug dies, a swallowed creature can crawl from the corpse by
using 10 feet of movement.

**Throw.** The gug throws one creature it has grappled. The
creature is thrown a distance of 2d4 times 10 feet in
the direction the gug chooses, and takes 20 (2d12 + 7)
bludgeoning damage (plus falling damage if they are thrown
into a chasm or off a cliff). A gug can throw a creature up to
Large size. Small creatures are thrown twice as far, but the
damage is the same.
