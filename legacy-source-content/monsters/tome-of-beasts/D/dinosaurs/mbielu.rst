Mbielu
------

This lumbering saurian quadruped has large, oblong plates of bone
covered in greenish slime protruding from its back and its thick,
club-like tail.

**Large Plates.** People describe this reptilian herbivore as “the
animal with planks growing out of its back.” The mbielu is a
large dinosaur akin to a stegosaurus, with square dorsal plates
that support symbiotic colonies of toxic, green algae. The plates
themselves are as large as shields.

**Aquatic Herbivore.** An mbielu spends most of its life
underwater, feeding on aquatic plants and avoiding the
withering glare of the harsh sun, but it comes onto land
frequently to sun itself for a few hours before immersing itself
once again.

**Toxic Alchemy.** Its dorsal plate algae undergo an alchemical
reaction in the continual transition between water and sky,
especially during mbielu migrations to new watery dens. The algae
produce a hallucinogenic contact poison that clouds the minds
of most creatures. Mbielus themselves are immune to the toxin.

**Toxic Skin.** A creature that touches the mbielu or hits it with a
melee attack exposes itself to the mbielu’s poisonous skin. The
creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw
or be :ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, a
creature also suffers disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma saving throws.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 20 (3d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a
creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or
be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Rollover.** If the mbielu is grappled by a Large creature, it rolls
on top of the grappler and crushes it. The mbielu automatically
escapes from the grapple and the grappler takes 20 (3d10 + 4)
bludgeoning damage.
