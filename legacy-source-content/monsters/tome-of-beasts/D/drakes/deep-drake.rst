Deep Drake
----------

*This large, unnerving drake’s glassy black scales have purple
undertones. Its features are elongated and almost alien. Black,
expressionless eyes stare ahead, and a barbed stinger sits at the
end of a long tail.*

**Friend to Ghouls.** The deep drake has made a niche
for itself in subterranean realms, establishing
trade with the darakhul and with other races
of the underworld. The drakes’ poison
ensures the ghouls have replacements when
their population dwindles. In return, those
underlings who fail their rulers become food for
the drake.

**Love Darkness.** Life underground has
warped the drakes. Whereas most drakes attach
themselves to humanoids, these creatures feel much
more at home with aberrations and undead. They
avoid sunlight and are strictly nocturnal when on the surface.

**Few in Number.** A deep drake mates for life with another
deep drake when two of these rare creatures meet. A
hermaphroditic creature, the drake assumes a gender until
it finds a mate, at which time it may change. Once every
10-20 years, the drakes reproduce, resulting in three or four
three‑foot long, rubbery eggs. Occasionally, subterranean
undead or aberrations take these eggs to their cities to train
the young drakes. A “household drake” is a great status symbol
in some deep places, and surface necromancers who have
heard of them are often extremely eager to acquire one.

Deep drakes are 12 feet long, plus a three-foot long tail, and
weigh up to 1,500 pounds. Their coloration makes them ideal
predators in the subterranean dark.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The drake makes one bite attack, two claw attacks,
and one stinger attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. *Hit:*
12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

**Stinger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison
damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution
saving throw or become :ref:`srd:poisoned` for 4 rounds. While poisoned
this way, the target must repeat the save at the start of its turn,
ending the condition on a success. On a failure, it takes 10 (3d6)
poison damage. When animate dead is cast on creatures killed
by this poison, the caster requires no material components.

**Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).** A deep drake blasts forth a
crackling 80-foot line of purple-black energy that wracks its
victims with pain. This attack deals 35 (10d6) necrotic damage,
or half damage with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw.
Targets that fail this saving throw must also succeed on a DC 16
Constitution saving throw or become :ref:`srd:stunned` for 1d4 rounds.
