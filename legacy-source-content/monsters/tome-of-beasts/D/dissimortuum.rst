Dissimortuum
------------

*This twisted humanoid has gray flesh and black claws that drip
blood. A bone mask is bound to its head by strips of putrid flesh
and a third arm hangs from the right side of the creature’s body, its
hand clutching a large sack stained with blood.*

**Plague Bringers.** Dissimortuum are undead monstrosities
constructed by necromancers to spread the undead plague,
slowly but surely. These creatures are rare but tenacious. A
dissimortuum obeys orders from the necromancer whose magic
created it.

When a dissimortuum kills, it collects body parts from its
victims and keeps them in a sack that it carries with its
third arm at all times. The monster sets down its sack
of trophies only when pressed in combat, to make the
most of its extra limb.

**Constructing Dissimortuum.** Even
when not following instructions,
a dissimortuum seeks to create
more of its own kind. The creature
wanders graveyards, battlefields,
and slums, searching for the
gruesome components it
needs to construct a mask
and body for its undead
offspring. The process
is slow, taking up to
a month to make a
single mask, but
a dissimortuum
has nothing but time. The new creation is independent and not
under the control of its maker.

**Donning the Mask.** The mask of a dissimortuum is nigh
indestructible. When the creature is destroyed, its mask usually
survives and breaks free. On its own, the object detects as
magical with mixed enchantment and necromantic auras. It is a
tempting souvenir, but anyone foolish enough to don the mask is
immediately wracked by pain and takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
The character must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving
throw or become dominated by the mask. The domination arrives
slowly. The character acts normally for a day or two, but then the
character notices periods of time that cannot be accounted for.
During these times, the character gathers the grisly components
needed to build a new body for the dissimortuum. This process
takes a week, after which the character is freed from domination
as the undead creature is reborn.
