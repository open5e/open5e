Duskthorn Dryad
---------------

*A duskthorn dryad is a striking woman with obvious fey features
and skin the color of slate, often found in the shade of an ancient
tree. Clothed in vines and leaves, it can be difficult to tell where one
leaves off and the other begins.*

**Creeper Vine Spirits.** Duskthorn dryads are spirits tied
to thorn-bearing creeper vines. They seek out dead trees and
use them as a home for their vines to cling to. They can travel
through trees to escape their foes but must stay near their vines.

**Create Guardians.** Duskthorn dryads use their vines and
the plants in their glades to defend themselves, animating
enormously strong vine troll skeletons as well as ordinary
skeletons, :ref:`children of the briar <tob:child-of-the-briar>`, and other horrors. These
defenders are linked to the tree and vines that animated them,
are controlled by hearts within the tree. If the hearts are
destroyed, the servants wither or scatter.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The dryad’s innate spellcasting ability
is Charisma (spell save DC 17). She can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:dancing-lights`, :ref:`srd:druidcraft`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:charm-person`, :ref:`srd:entangle`, :ref:`srd:invisibility`, :ref:`srd:magic-missile`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:barkskin`, :ref:`srd:counterspell`, :ref:`srd:dispel-magic`, :ref:`srd:fog-cloud`,
:ref:`srd:shillelagh`, :ref:`srd:suggestion`, :ref:`srd:wall-of-thorns`

**Magic Resistance.** The dryad has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

**Speak with Beasts and Plants.** The dryad can communicate
with beasts and plants as if they shared a language.

**Tree Stride.** Once on her turn, the dryad can use 10 feet of her
movement to step magically into one dead tree within her
reach and emerge from a second dead tree within 60 feet of
the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet
of the second tree. Both trees must be Large or bigger.

**Tree Dependent.** The dryad is mystically bonded to her
duskthorn vines and must remain within 300 yards of them or
become :ref:`srd:poisoned`. If she remains out of range of her vines for
24 hours, she suffers 1d6 Constitution damage, and another
1d6 points of Constitution damage every day that follows—
eventually, this separation kills the dryad. A dryad can bond
with new vines by performing a 24-hour ritual.
