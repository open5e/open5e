Dragon, Wind
------------

*Howling wind encircles the white- and gray-scaled dragon, filling
and pushing its wings without the need for them to beat.*

Wind dragons view anywhere touched by air as their property,
and mortals point to them as the epitome of arrogance. Their
narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power
supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the
shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter. Although wind
dragon wyrmlings are the weakest of the newborn dragons,
they grow in power rapidly, and few fully-grown dragons are
seen as stronger.

**Braggarts and Bullies.** Wind dragons number among
the greatest bullies and worst tyrants among mortal creatures.
The sometimes foolhardy creatures take personal offense at
any perceived challenge and great pleasure in humiliating
rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for
its governance, and they perceive the mortals in that territory
as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in
exchange for unflinching loyalty. A wind dragon might seek
bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it’s unlikely
to go to any length to prevent the loss of life in the first place.

**Lords of the Far Horizons.** Some believe that the
dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable
of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they
prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the
highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a
towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons
are also driven by wanderlust, and often travel far from their
thrones. They always return eventually, ready to subjugate new
generations and to press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone
who questions their right to rule.

**Perpetual Infighting.** These wandering tyrants are even
more territorial among their own kind than they are among
groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the
territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus their
numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are
frequently culled.

Wind dragons’ hoards typically consist of only a few truly
valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins,
but common things bore wind dragons quickly. While all
true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons
concentrate their riches in a smaller number of notable trophies
or unique historic items—often quite portable.

Wind Dragon's Lair
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wind dragons make their lairs in locations where they can
overlook and dominate the land they claim as theirs, but remote
enough so the inhabitants can’t pester them with requests for
protection or justice. They have little to fear from the elements,
so a shallow cave high up on an exposed mountain face is ideal.
Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall,
sheer cliffs where the dragon can perch in the howling wind and
catch staggering updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through the
canyons and tearing across the crags. Non-flying creatures find
these locations much less hospitable.

Lair Actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a
lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon
can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row.

* Sand and dust swirls up from the floor in a 20-foot radius
  sphere within 120 feet of the dragon at a point the dragon
  can see. The sphere spreads around corners. The area inside
  the sphere is lightly obscured, and each creature in the
  sphere at the start of its turn must make a successful DC
  15 Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`srd:blinded` for 1 minute. A
  blinded creature repeats the saving throw at the start of each
  of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.
* Fragments of ice and stone are torn from the lair’s wall by a
  blast of wind and flung along a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the
  cone take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, or half damage with a
  successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.
* A torrent of wind blasts outward from the dragon in a 60-foot
  radius, either racing just above the floor or near the ceiling.
  If near the floor, it affects all creatures standing in the radius;
  if near the ceiling, it affects all creatures flying in the radius.
  Affected creatures must make a successful DC 15 Strength
  saving throw or be knocked :ref:`srd:prone` and stunned until the end
  of their next turn.
