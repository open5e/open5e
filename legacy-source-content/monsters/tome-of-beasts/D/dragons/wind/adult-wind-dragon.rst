**Innate Spellcasting.** The dragon’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 18). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:feather-fall`

**3/day:** :ref:`srd:lightning-bolt`

**Fog Vision.** The dragon sees normally through light or heavy
obscurement caused by fog, mist, clouds, or high wind.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving
throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The dragon has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

**Uncontrollable.** The dragon’s movement is never impeded
by difficult terrain, and its speed can’t be reduced by
spells or magical effects. It can’t be restrained (per
the condition), and it escapes automatically from
any nonmagical restraints (such as chains,
entanglement, or grappling) by spending
5 feet of movement. Being underwater
imposes no penalty on its movement
or attacks.

**Whirling Winds.** Gale-force winds
rage around the dragon. Ranged
weapon attacks against it are
made with disadvantage.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The wind dragon
can use its Frightful Presence
and then makes three attacks:
one with its bite, and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach
10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

**Breath of Gales (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales a blast
of wind in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that cone takes 27
(5d10) bludgeoning damage and is pushed 25 feet away from
the dragon and knocked :ref:`srd:prone`; a successful DC 20 Strength
saving throw halves the damage and prevents being pushed
(but not being knocked prone). All flames in the cone are
extinguished.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that
is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed
on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for
1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of
its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature
is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next
24 hours.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used
at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The
dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings.
Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a
DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning
damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon can then fly up to
half its flying speed.
