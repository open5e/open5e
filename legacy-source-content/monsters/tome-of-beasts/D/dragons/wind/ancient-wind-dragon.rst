**Innate Spellcasting.** The dragon’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 20). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:feather-fall`

**5/day each:** :ref:`srd:lightning-bolt`, :ref:`srd:ice-storm`

**Fog Vision.** The dragon sees normally through light or heavy
obscurement caused by fog, mist, clouds, or high wind.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving
throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance.** The dragon has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

**Uncontrollable.** The dragon’s movement is never impeded by
difficult terrain, and its speed can’t be reduced by spells or
magical effects. It can’t be restrained (per the condition), and
it escapes automatically from any nonmagical restraints (such
as chains, entanglement, or grappling) by spending 5 feet
of movement. Being underwater imposes no penalty on its
movement or attacks.

**Whirling Winds.** Gale-force winds rage around the dragon,
making it immune to ranged weapon attacks except for those
from siege weapons.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The wind dragon can use its Frightful Presence
and then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with
its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 22 (2d12 + 9) piercing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 18 (2d8 + 9) slashing damage.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 20 (2d10 + 9) bludgeoning damage.

**Breath of Gales (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales a blast
of wind in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that cone takes
55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and is pushed 50 feet away
from the dragon and knocked :ref:`srd:prone`; a successful DC 23
Strength saving throw halves the damage and prevents being
pushed (but not being knocked prone). All flames in the cone
are extinguished.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that
is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed
on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for
1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of
its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature
is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24
hours.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used
at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The
dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings.
Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed
on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 20 (2d10 + 9)
bludgeoning damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon can
then fly up to half its flying speed.
