Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful
Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with
its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach
10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (2d10 + 8) piercing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 15 (2d6 +8) slashing damage, and the target loses 4 hit
points from bleeding at the start of each of its turns for six
rounds unless it receives magical healing. Bleeding damage is
cumulative; the target loses 4 hp per round for each bleeding
wound it’s taken from a mithral dragon’s claws.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that
is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed
on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for 1
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is
immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).** A mithral dragon can spit a
60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line of metallic shards. Targets in its
path take 42 (12d6) magical slashing damage and lose another
8 hit points from bleeding at the start of their turns for 6
rounds; slashing and bleed damage are halved by a successful
DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. Only magical healing stops the
bleeding before 6 rounds. The shards dissolve into wisps of
smoke 1 round after the breath weapon’s use.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at
a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The dragon
regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings.
Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a
DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning
damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon can then fly up to
half its flying speed.
