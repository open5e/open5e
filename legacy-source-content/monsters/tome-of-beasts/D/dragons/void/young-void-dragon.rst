Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite
and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon uses one of the
following breath weapons.

  **Gravitic Breath.** The dragon exhales a 30-foot cube of
  powerful localized gravity, originating from the dragon.
  Falling damage in the area increases to 1d10 per 10 feet
  fallen. When a creature starts its turn within the area or
  enters it for the first time in a turn, including when the
  dragon creates the field, it must make a DC 17 Dexterity
  saving throw. On a failure the creature is :ref:`srd:restrained`. On a
  success the creature’s speed is halved as long as it remains
  in the field. A restrained creature repeats the saving throw at
  the end of its turn. The field persists until the dragon’s breath
  recharges, and it can’t use gravitic breath twice consecutively.

  **Stellar Flare Breath.** The dragon exhales star fire in a 30foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17
  Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage and
  28 (8d6) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much
  damage on a successful one.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Void Twist.** When the dragon is hit by a ranged attack it can
create a small rift in space to increase its AC by 4 against that
attack. If the attack misses because of this increase the dragon
can choose a creature within 30 feet to become the new target
for that attack. Use the original attack roll to determine if the
attack hits the new target.
