Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes one bite attack and two claw attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that
is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed
on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for
1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect
ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful
Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales fire in a
60-foot cone. Each creature in that area takes 63 (18d6) fire
damage, or half damage with a successful DC 19 Dexterity
saving throw. Each creature in that area must also succeed on a
DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or go on a rampage for 1 minute.
A rampaging creature must attack the nearest living creature
or smash some object smaller than itself if no creature can be
reached with a single move. A rampaging creature repeats the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
on itself on a success.

**Shifting Flames.** The dragon magically polymorphs into a
creature that has immunity to fire damage and a size and
challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true
form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is
wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form
(the dragon’s choice). In a new form, the dragon retains its
alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies,
Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and
capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form,
except any class features or legendary actions of that form.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used
at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The
dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings.
Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a
DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning
damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon can then fly up to
half its flying speed.
