**Darkness Aura.** An adult or older cave dragon can generate
an aura of darkness that fills its space and the surrounding
20 feet. This darkness prevents normal vision and darkvision
from functioning. Blindsight and truesight function normally.
Activating or deactivating the aura is a bonus action.

**Earth Glide.** An adult cave dragon glides through stone, dirt,
or any sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish glides
through water. Its burrowing produces no ripple or other sign
of its presence and leaves no tunnel or hole unless the dragon
chooses to do so; in that case, it creates a passageway 15 feet
wide by 10 feet high. The spell move earth cast on an area
containing an earth-gliding cave dragon flings the dragon
back 30 feet and stuns the creature for one round unless it
succeeds on a Constitution saving throw.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the dragon fails a saving
throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The dragon’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 18). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:detect-magic`, :ref:`srd:speak-with-dead`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:blur`, :ref:`srd:counterspell`, :ref:`srd:darkness`, :ref:`srd:web`

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:dispel-magic`, :ref:`srd:hold-person`

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 18 (3d6 + 8) plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that
is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed
on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for 1
minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a
creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it,
the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for
the next 24 hours.

**Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales a cone
of black poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each target in that
area takes 56 (16d6) poison damage and is :ref:`srd:poisoned` if it is a
creature; a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw reduces
damage by half and negates the poisoned condition. The
poisoned condition lasts until the target takes a long or short
rest or it’s removed with :ref:`srd:lesser-restoration` or comparable magic.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Ruff Spikes.** When a creature tries to enter a space adjacent to
a cave dragon, the dragon flares its many feelers and spikes.
The creature cannot enter a space adjacent to the dragon
unless it makes a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. If
the saving throw fails, the creature can keep moving but only
into spaces that aren’t within 5 feet of the dragon and takes 10
(3d6) piercing damage from spikes.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used
at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The
dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Reset Ruff Spikes.** The dragon can use its ruff spikes as a
reaction again before its next turn.

**Tail.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Swift Bite (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon makes two bite attacks.
