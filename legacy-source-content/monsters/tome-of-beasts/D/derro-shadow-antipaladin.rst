Derro Shadow Antipaladin
------------------------

*This blue-skinned creature resembles a stunted dwarf. Its eyes are
large and its hair wild, and both are colorless. The expression on its
face is a terrible rictus of madness and hate.*

All derro are mad, but some devote their very souls to the service
of insanity. They embrace the powers of darkness and channel
shadow through their minds to break the sanity of any creatures
they encounter. Derro shadow antipaladins are the elite servants
of gods like Nyarlathotep and the Black Goat of the Woods.

**Herald of Madness.** The derro shadow antipaladin
is insanity personified. Despite being called paladins,
these unhinged creatures aren’t swaggering warriors
encased in steel or their dark reflections. Instead, a
shadow antipaladin serves as a more subtle vector
for the madness of its patron. They are masters
of shadow magic and stealth who attack the faith
of those who believe that goodness can survive the
approaching, dark apotheosis. Death, madness, and
darkness spread in the shadow antipaladin’s wake.
