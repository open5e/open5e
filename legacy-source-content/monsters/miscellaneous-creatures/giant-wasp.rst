Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Sting**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit*: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11
Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage
reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but :ref:`srd:poisoned`
for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is :ref:`srd:paralyzed` while
:ref:`srd:poisoned` in this way.
