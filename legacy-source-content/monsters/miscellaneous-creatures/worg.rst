A **worg** is an evil predator that delights in hunting and devouring
creatures weaker than itself. Cunning and malevolent, worgs roam across
the remote wilderness or are raised by goblins and hobgoblins. Those
creatures use worgs as mounts, but a worg will turn on its rider if it
feels mistreated or malnourished. Worgs speak in their own language and
Goblin, and a few learn to speak Common as well.
