Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape
DC 11). Until this grapple ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained`, and the frog
can't bite another target.

**Swallow**: The frog makes one bite attack
against a Small or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits,
the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is
:ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`, it has total cover against attacks and other
effects outside the frog, and it takes 5 (2d4) acid damage at the start
of each of the frog's turns. The frog can have only one target swallowed
at a time.

If the frog dies, a swallowed creature is no longer :ref:`srd:restrained` by it and
can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting :ref:`srd:prone`.
