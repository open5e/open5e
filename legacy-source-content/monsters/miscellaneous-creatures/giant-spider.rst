Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit*: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11
Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage
reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but :ref:`srd:poisoned`
for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is :ref:`srd:paralyzed` while
:ref:`srd:poisoned` in this way.

**Web (Recharge 5-6)**: *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +5
to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. *Hit*: The target is :ref:`srd:restrained`
by webbing. As an action, the :ref:`srd:restrained` target can make a DC 12
Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also
be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage;
immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

To snare its prey, a **giant spider** spins elaborate webs or shoots
sticky strands of webbing from its abdomen. Giant spiders are most
commonly found underground, making their lairs on ceilings or in dark,
web-filled crevices. Such lairs are often festooned with web cocoons
holding past victims.
