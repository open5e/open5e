Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tentacles**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a
creature, it is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the
target is :ref:`srd:restrained`, and the octopus can't use its tentacles on another
target.

**Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)**: A 20-
foot-radius cloud of ink extends all around the octopus if it is
underwater. The area is heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a
significant current can disperse the ink. After releasing the ink, the
octopus can use the Dash action as a bonus action.
