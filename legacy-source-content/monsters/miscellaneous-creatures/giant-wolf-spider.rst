Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit*: 4 (1d6 + 1) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11
Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage
reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but :ref:`srd:poisoned`
for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is :ref:`srd:paralyzed` while
:ref:`srd:poisoned` in this way.

Smaller than a giant spider, a **giant wolf spider** hunts prey across
open ground or hides in a burrow or crevice, or in a hidden cavity
beneath debris.
