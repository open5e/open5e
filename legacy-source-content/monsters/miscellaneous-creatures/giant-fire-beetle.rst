A **giant fire beetle** is a nocturnal creature that takes its name from
a pair of glowing glands that give off light. Miners and adventurers
prize these creatures, for a giant fire beetle's glands continue to shed
light for 1d6 days after the beetle dies. Giant fire beetles are most
commonly found underground and in dark forests.
