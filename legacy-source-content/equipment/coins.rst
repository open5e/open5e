Coins
------

Common coins come in several different denominations based on the
relative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most
common coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the
copper piece (cp). With one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll,
50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan
can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of
measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When
merchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or
thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the
exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is a standard
measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold bars, letters of
credit, or valuable goods.

One gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among
commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer's work for half a day, a flask
of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn.

One silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among
laborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a
piece of chalk.

In addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes
appear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum
piece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they
sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions. An
electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece is
worth ten gold pieces.

A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a
pound.
