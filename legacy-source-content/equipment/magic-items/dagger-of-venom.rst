Dagger of Venom
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (dagger), rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon.

You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade.
The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon
hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become :ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1
minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
