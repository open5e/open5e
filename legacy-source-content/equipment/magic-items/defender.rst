Defender
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon.

The first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can
transfer some or all of the sword's bonus to your Armor Class, instead
of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could
reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2
bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of
your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC
from it.
