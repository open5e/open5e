Boots of Striding and Springing
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 30 feet, unless
your walking speed is higher, and your speed isn't reduced if you are
encumbered or wearing heavy armor. In addition, you can jump three times
the normal distance, though you can't jump farther than your remaining
movement would allow.
