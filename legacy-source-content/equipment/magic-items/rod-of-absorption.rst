Rod of Absorption
------------------------------------------------------


*Rod, very rare (requires attunement)*

While holding this rod, you can use your reaction to absorb a spell that
is targeting only you and not with an area of effect. The absorbed
spell's effect is canceled, and the spell's energy---not the spell
itself---is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell
when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy
over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of
energy, it can't absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the
rod can't store, the rod has no effect on that spell.

When you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy
the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many
levels of spell energy it currently has stored.

If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored
in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can
create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell
slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place
of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you
can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.

A newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already.
A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining
becomes nonmagical.
