Talisman of the Sphere
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*

When you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to control a *sphere of
annihilation* while you are holding this talisman, you double your
proficiency bonus on the check. In addition, when you start your turn
with control over a *sphere of annihilation*, you can use an action to
levitate it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 × your
Intelligence modifier.
