Sun Blade
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)*

This item appears to be a longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you
can use a bonus action to cause a blade of pure radiance to spring into
existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this
magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with
shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the *sun blade*.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls
made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing
damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8
radiant damage.

The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and
dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the
blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of
bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a
minimum of 10 feet each.
