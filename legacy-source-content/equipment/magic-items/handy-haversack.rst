Handy Haversack
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rare*

This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is
an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of
material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central
pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack
always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.

Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for
interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires
you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific
item, the item is always magically on top.

The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp
object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed.
If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although
an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned
inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must
be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is
placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10
minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a :ref:`srd:bag-of-holding`, :ref:`srd:portable-hole`, or similar item instantly destroys both
items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where
the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of
the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the
Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't
be reopened.
