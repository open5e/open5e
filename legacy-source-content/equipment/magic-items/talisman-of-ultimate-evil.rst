Talisman of Ultimate Evil
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of evil
alignment)*

This item symbolizes unrepentant evil. A creature that is neither good
nor evil in alignment takes 6d6 necrotic damage upon touching the
talisman. A good creature takes 8d6 necrotic damage upon touching the
talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it
ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

If you are an evil cleric or paladin, you can use the talisman as a holy
symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or
hold it.

The talisman has 6 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can
use an action to expend 1 charge from the talisman and choose one
creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target
is of good alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. The target must
succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and
be destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no
trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman
dissolves into foul-smelling slime and is destroyed.
