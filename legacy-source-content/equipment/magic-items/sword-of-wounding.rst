Sword of Wounding
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)*

Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a
short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other
means.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this magic
weapon, you can wound the target. At the start of each of the wounded
creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've
wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw,
ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success.
Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it,
can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the
effect of such wounds on it on a success.
