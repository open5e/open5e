Wand of Binding
------------------------------------------------------


*Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1
expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge,
roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

**Spells.** While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend
some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17):
:ref:`srd:hold-monster` (5 charges) or :ref:`srd:hold-person` (2 charges).

**Assisted Escape.** While holding the wand, you can use your reaction
to expend 1 charge and gain advantage on a saving throw you make to
avoid being :ref:`srd:paralyzed` or :ref:`srd:restrained`, or you can expend 1 charge and gain
advantage on any check you make to escape a grapple.
