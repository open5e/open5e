Arrow of Slaying
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (arrow), very rare*

An *arrow of slaying* is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind
of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are
both *arrows of dragon slaying* and *arrows of blue dragon slaying*. If
a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an
*arrow of slaying* takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a
DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on
a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an *arrow of slaying* deals its extra damage to
a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as *bolts of
slaying* meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.
