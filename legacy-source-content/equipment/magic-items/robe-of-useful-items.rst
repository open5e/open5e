Robe of Useful Items
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it.
While wearing the robe, you can use an action to detach one of the
patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once
the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment.

The robe has two of each of the following patches:

-  Dagger

-  Bullseye lantern (filled and lit)

-  Steel mirror

-  10-foot pole

-  Hempen rope (50 feet, coiled)

-  Sack

In addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches. The GM chooses the patches
or determines them randomly.
