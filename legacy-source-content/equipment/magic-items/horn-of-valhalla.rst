Horn of Valhalla
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary
(iron)*

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits
from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics
of a berserker. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they
drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again
until 7 days have passed.

Four types of *horn of Valhalla* are known to exist, each made of a
different metal. The horn's type determines how many berserkers answer
its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the
horn's type or determines it randomly.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned
berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to
you and your companions and follow your commands.
