Carpet of Flying
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, very rare*

You can speak the carpet's command word as an action to make the carpet
hover and fly. It moves according to your spoken directions, provided
that you are within 30 feet of it.

Four sizes of *carpet of flying* exist. The GM chooses the size of a
given carpet or determines it randomly.

=============  ==================  ============  =======================
d100           Size                Capacity      Flying Speed
=============  ==================  ============  =======================
01--20         3 ft. × 5 ft.       200 lb.       80 feet
21--55         4 ft. × 6 ft.       400 lb.       60 feet
56--80         5 ft. × 7 ft.       600 lb.       40 feet
81--100        6 ft. × 9 ft.       800 lb.       30 feet
=============  ==================  ============  =======================

A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but it
flies at half speed if it carries more than its normal capacity.
