Helm of Brilliance
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire
opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust.
When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.

You gain the following benefits while wearing it:

-  You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC
   18), using one of the helm's gems of the specified type as a
   component: :ref:`srd:daylight` (opal), :ref:`srd:fireball` (fire opal), :ref:`srd:prismatic-spray`
   (diamond), or :ref:`srd:wall-of-fire` (ruby). The gem is destroyed when
   the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.

-  As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a
   30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any
   undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.

-  As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to
   fire damage.

-  As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action
   and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst
   into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and
   dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you
   and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon,
   the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you
   use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop
   or stow the weapon.

Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result
of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm
emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60
feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving
throw or be
struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in
the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.
