Censer of Controlling Air Elementals
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rare*

While incense is burning in this censer, you can use an action to speak
the censer's command word and summon an air elemental, as if you had
cast the :ref:`srd:conjure-elemental` spell. The censer can't be used this way
again until the next dawn.

This 6-inch-wide, 1-foot-high vessel resembles a
chalice with a decorated lid. It weighs 1 pound.
