Winged Boots
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your
walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at
once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute
from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you
descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.

The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they
aren't in use.
