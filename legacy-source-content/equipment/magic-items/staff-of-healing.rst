Staff of Healing
------------------------------------------------------


*Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, or druid)*

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from
it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier:
:ref:`srd:cure-wounds` (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), :ref:`srd:lesser-restoration` (2
charges), or :ref:`srd:mass-cure-wounds` (5 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of
light, lost forever.
