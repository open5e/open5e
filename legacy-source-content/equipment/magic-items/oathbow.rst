Oathbow
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)*

When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, "Swift defeat
to my enemies." When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you
can, as a command phrase, say, "Swift death to you who have wronged me."
The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or
until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a
time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the
next dawn.

When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn
enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no
benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no
disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy
takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.

While your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with
all other weapons.
