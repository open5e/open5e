Rope of Entanglement
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rare*

This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of
the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end
darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you.
The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become
:ref:`srd:restrained`.

You can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second
command word. A target :ref:`srd:restrained` by the rope can use an action to make
a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target's choice). On a success, the
creature is no longer :ref:`srd:restrained` by the rope.

The rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5
minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0
hit points, it is destroyed.
