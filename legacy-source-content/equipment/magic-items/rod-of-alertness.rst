Rod of Alertness
------------------------------------------------------


*Rod, very rare (requires attunement)*

This rod has a flanged head and the following properties.

**Alertness.** While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.

**Spells.** While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one
of the following spells from it:
:ref:`srd:detect-evil-and-good`, :ref:`srd:detect-magic`, :ref:`srd:detect-poison-and-disease`, or
:ref:`srd:see-invisibility`.

**Protective Aura.** As an action, you can plant the haft end of the
rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds bright light in a
60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that
bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1
bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any
:ref:`srd:invisible` hostile creature that is also in the bright light.

The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends
after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from
the ground. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
