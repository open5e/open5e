Ring of the Ram
------------------------------------------------------


*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

This ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at
dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of
its charges to attack one creature you can see within 60 feet of you.
The ring produces a spectral ram's head and makes its attack roll with a
+7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10
force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.

Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring's charges as an action
to try to break an object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn't
being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus
for each charge you spend.
