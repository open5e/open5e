Amulet of the Planes
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that
you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15
Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the :ref:`srd:plane-shift`
spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of
you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1--60, you travel
to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61--100, you travel to
a randomly determined plane of existence.
