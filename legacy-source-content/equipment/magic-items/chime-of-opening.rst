Chime of Opening
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rare*

This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound.
You can strike it as an action, pointing it at an object within 120 feet
of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. The chime
issues a clear tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless
the sound can't reach the object. If no locks or latches remain, the
object itself opens.

The chime can be used ten times. After the tenth time, it cracks and
becomes useless.
