Robe of Robe of Stars
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This black or dark blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver
stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.

Six stars, located on the robe's upper front portion, are particularly
large. While wearing this robe, you can use an action to pull off one of
the stars and use it to cast *magic missile* as a 5th-level spell.
Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.

While you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane
along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there
until you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You
reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied,
the nearest unoccupied space.
