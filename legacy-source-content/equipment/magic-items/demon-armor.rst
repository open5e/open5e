Demon Armor
------------------------------------------------------


*Armor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can
understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor's clawed gauntlets
turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal
slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a
damage die of 1d8.

**Curse.** Once you don this cursed armor, you can't doff it unless
you are targeted by the :ref:`srd:remove-curse` spell or similar magic. While
wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons
and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.
