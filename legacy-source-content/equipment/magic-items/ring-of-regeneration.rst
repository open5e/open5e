Ring of Regeneration
------------------------------------------------------


*Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you regain 1d6 hit points every 10 minutes,
provided that you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part,
the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full
functionality after 1d6 + 1 days if you have at least 1 hit point the
whole time.
