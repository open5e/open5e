Nine Lives Stealer
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon.

The sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a
creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its
life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword
loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges
remaining, it loses this property.
