Wings of Flying
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command
word. This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on
your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action.
The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you
can't use them again for 1d12 hours.
