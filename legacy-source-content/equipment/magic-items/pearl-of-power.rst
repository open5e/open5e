Pearl of Power
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

While this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its
command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot
was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you
use the pearl, it can't be used again until the next
dawn.
