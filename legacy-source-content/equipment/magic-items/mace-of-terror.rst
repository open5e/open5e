Mace of Terror
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)*

This magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action
and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your
choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15
Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` of you for 1 minute. While it
is :ref:`srd:frightened` in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to
move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a
space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its
action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect
that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the
creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a
creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a
success.

The mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.
