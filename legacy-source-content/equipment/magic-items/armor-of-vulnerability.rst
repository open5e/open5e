Armor of Vulnerability
------------------------------------------------------


*Armor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)*

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following damage
types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the type or
determines it randomly.

**Curse.** This armor is cursed, a fact that
is revealed only when an :ref:`srd:identify` spell is cast on the armor or you
attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by
the *remove curse* spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to
end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three
damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants
resistance).
