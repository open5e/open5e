Periapt of Wound Closure
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the
start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain
hit points, double the number of hit points it restores.
