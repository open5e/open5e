Pipes of Haunting
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

You must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They
have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge
to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of
you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
become :ref:`srd:frightened` of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the
area that aren't hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving
throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A
creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of
these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at
dawn.
