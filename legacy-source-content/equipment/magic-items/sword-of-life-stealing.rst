Sword of Life Stealing
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)*

When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the
attack roll, that target takes an extra 3d6 necrotic damage, provided
that the target isn't a construct or an undead. You gain temporary hit
points equal to the extra damage dealt.
