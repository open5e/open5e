Mirror of Life Trapping
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, very rare*

When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows
faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC
11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters
and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.

If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet
of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it.
It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word
again.

Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated
mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma
saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or
carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This
saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's
nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.

An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog
that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's
cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature
trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel.
Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.

If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are
already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to
accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied
space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror
is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in
unoccupied spaces near it.

While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the
name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by
number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an
image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate
normally.

In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word
and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears,
along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the
mirror and facing away from it.
