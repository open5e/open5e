Helm of Telepathy
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the :ref:`srd:detect-thoughts` spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain
concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a
telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply---using
a bonus action to do so---while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with *detect thoughts*, you can use an
action to cast the :ref:`srd:suggestion` spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that
creature. Once used, the :ref:`srd:suggestion` property can't be used again until
the next dawn.
