Wand of Lightning Bolts
------------------------------------------------------


*Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the *lightning bolt* spell (save
DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level version of the
spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional
charge you expend.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes
and is destroyed.
