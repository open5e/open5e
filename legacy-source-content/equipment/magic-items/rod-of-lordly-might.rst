Rod of Lordly Might
------------------------------------------------------


*Rod, legendary (requires attunement)*

This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that
grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has
properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row
along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.

**Six Buttons.** You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus
action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or
until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to
its normal form.

If you press **button 1**, the rod becomes a :ref:`srd:flame-tongue`, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's
flanged head.

If you press **button 2**, the rod's flanged head folds down and two
crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic
battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with
it.

If you press **button 3**, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear
point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a
6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3
bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

If you press **button 4**, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to
50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at
the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3
inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The
pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring
causes the rod to revert to its normal form.

If you press **button 5**, the rod transforms into a handheld battering
ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break
through doors, barricades, and other barriers.

If you press **button 6**, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form
and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the
rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also
gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your
height above it.

**Drain Life.** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the
rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.
On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you
regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This
property can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Paralyze.** When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the
rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On
a failure, the target is :ref:`srd:paralyzed` for 1 minute. The target can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a
success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Terrify.** While holding the rod, you can use an action to force
each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw. On a failure, a target is :ref:`srd:frightened` of you for 1 minute.
A :ref:`srd:frightened` target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't
be used again until the next dawn.
