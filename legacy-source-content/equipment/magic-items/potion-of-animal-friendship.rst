Potion of Animal Friendship
------------------------------------------------------


*Potion, uncommon*

When you drink this potion, you can cast the *animal friendship* spell
(save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings
little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw,
or a squirrel hair.
