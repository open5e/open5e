Sword of Sharpness
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), very rare (requires
attunement)*

When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your
weapon damage dice against the target.

When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack
roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 slashing damage. Then roll another
d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target's limbs, with the
effect of such loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb to
sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.

In addition, you can speak the sword's command word to cause the blade
to shed bright light in a 10- foot radius and dim light for an
additional 10 feet. Speaking the command word again or sheathing the
sword puts out the light.
