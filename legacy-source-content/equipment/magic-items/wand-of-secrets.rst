Wand of Secrets
------------------------------------------------------


*Wand, uncommon*

The wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 of its charges, and if a secret door or trap is within 30 feet
of you, the wand
pulses and points at the one nearest to you. The wand regains 1d3
expended charges daily at dawn.
