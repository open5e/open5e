Staff of Fire
------------------------------------------------------


*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or
wizard)*

You have resistance to fire damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from
it, using your spell save DC: :ref:`srd:burning-hands` (1 charge), :ref:`srd:fireball` (3
charges), or :ref:`srd:wall-of-fire` (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily
at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff
blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
