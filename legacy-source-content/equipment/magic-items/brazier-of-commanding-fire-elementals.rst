Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rare*

While a fire burns in this brass brazier, you can use an action to speak
the brazier's command word and summon a fire elemental, as if you had
cast the :ref:`srd:conjure-elemental` spell. The brazier can't be used this way
again until the next dawn.

The brazier weighs 5 pounds.
