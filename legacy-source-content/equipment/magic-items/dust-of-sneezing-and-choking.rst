Dust of Sneezing and Choking
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It
appears to be :ref:`srd:dust-of-disappearance`, and an :ref:`srd:identify` spell reveals
it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you
and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must
succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to
breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way
is :ref:`srd:incapacitated` and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on it on a success. The *lesser restoration* spell can also end
the effect on a creature.
