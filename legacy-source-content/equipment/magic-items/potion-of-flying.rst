Potion of Flying
------------------------------------------------------


*Potion, very rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your
walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you're in the air when the
potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying
aloft. This potion's clear liquid floats at the top of its container and
has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.
