Gem of Brightness
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an
action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following
effects:

-  The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a
   30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect
   doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to
   repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.

-  The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a
   brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of
   you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw
   or become :ref:`srd:blinded` for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving
   throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
   a success.

-  The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare
   with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each
   creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the
   beam created with the second command word.

When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical
jewel worth 50 gp.
