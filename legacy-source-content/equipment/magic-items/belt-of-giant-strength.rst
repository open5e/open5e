Belt of Giant Strength
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)*

While wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to a score granted
by the belt. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the
belt's score, the item has no effect on you.

Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity
according to the six kinds of true giants. The *belt of stone giant
strength* and the *belt of frost giant strength* look different, but
they have the same effect.
