Feather Token
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rare*

This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens
exist, each with a different single- use effect. The GM chooses the
kind of token or determines it randomly.

=======  ===================  =======  ================================
d100     Feather Token        d100     Feather Token
=======  ===================  =======  ================================
01--20   Anchor               51--65   Swan boat
21--35   Bird                 66--90   Tree
36--50   Fan                  91--00   Whip
=======  ===================  =======  ================================

**Anchor.** You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or
ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can't be moved by any means.
Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect
ends, the token disappears.

**Bird.** You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air.
The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place.
The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands
and can't attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its
maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with
a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half
that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a
day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an
action.

**Fan.** If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss
the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant
flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong
enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its
speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an
action.

**Swan Boat.** You can use an action to touch the token to a body of
water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a
50-foot-long, 20-foot- wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place.
The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles
per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move
or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium
or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures,
while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and
then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.

**Tree.** You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an
action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token
disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into
existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk,
and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.

**Whip.** You can use an action to throw the token to
a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip
takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell
attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack
bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6+5 force damage.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20
feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The
whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or
when you are :ref:`srd:incapacitated` or die.
