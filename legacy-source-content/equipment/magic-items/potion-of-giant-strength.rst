Potion of Giant Strength
------------------------------------------------------


*Potion, rarity varies*

When you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The
type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has
no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that
score.

This potion's transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of
fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The *potion of
frost giant strength* and the *potion of stone giant strength* have
the same effect.
