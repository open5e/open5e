Mounts and Vehicles
-------------------

A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness, but
its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you
down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal's speed and
base carrying capacity.

An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move
weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight
of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add
their carrying capacity together.

Mounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming
worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These
include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar
animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example).
Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the
creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or
negotiating with the mount itself.

**Barding.** Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head,
neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be
purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made
for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.

**Saddles.** A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your
seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check
you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle is required for riding any
aquatic or flying mount.

**Vehicle Proficiency.** If you have proficiency with a certain kind
of vehicle (land or water), you can add your proficiency bonus to any
check you make to control that kind of vehicle in difficult
circumstances.

**Rowed Vessels.** Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and
rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3
miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be
rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream
by draft animals on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case
adventurers carry it over land.
