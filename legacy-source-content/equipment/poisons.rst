Poisons
-------

Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most
societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil
creatures.

Poisons come in the following four types.

**Contact.** Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains
potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches
contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

**Ingested.** A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested
poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a
liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as
allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a
failed save.

**Inhaled.** These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when
inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a
5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately
afterward. Holding one's breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons,
as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

**Injury.** Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap
components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and
remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature
that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the
poison is exposed to its effects.

Sample Poisons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each type of poison has its own debilitating effects.
