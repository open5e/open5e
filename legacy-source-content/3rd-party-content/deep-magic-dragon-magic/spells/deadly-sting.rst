Deadly Sting
------------

8th-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*sorcerer, wizard*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a thorn)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You grow a 10-foot-long tail as supple as a whip,
tipped with a horrible stinger. During the spell’s
duration, you can use the stinger to make a melee
spell attack with a reach of 10 feet. On a hit, the target
takes 1d4 piercing damage plus 4d10 poison damage,
and a creature must make a successful Constitution
saving throw or become vulnerable to poison damage
for the duration of the spell.
