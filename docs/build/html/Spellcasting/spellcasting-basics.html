<h1>Spellcasting<a class="headerlink" href="#spellcasting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Magic permeates fantasy gaming worlds and often appears in the form of a
spell.</p>
<p>This chapter provides the rules for casting spells. Different character
classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells,
and monsters use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a
spell follows the rules here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-a-spell">
<h1>What Is a Spell?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-spell" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical
energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited
expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the
invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place
in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then
releases them to unleash the desired effect—in most cases, all in the
span of seconds.</p>
<p>Spells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They can
deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see appendix A),
drain life energy away, and restore life to the dead.</p>
<p>Uncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of the
multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some might
yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient ruins or
trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be reinvented
by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to do so.</p>
<div class="section" id="spell-level">
<h2>Spell Level<a class="headerlink" href="#spell-level" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general
indicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still impressive)
<em>magic missile</em> at 1st level and the earth-­shaking <em>wish</em> at 9th.
Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by
rote—are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the higher level a
spellcaster must be to use that spell.</p>
<p>Spell level and character level don’t correspond directly. Typically, a
character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level, to cast a
9th-­level spell.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="known-and-prepared-spells">
<h2>Known and Prepared Spells<a class="headerlink" href="#known-and-prepared-spells" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell
firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item.
Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited
list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind. The same thing
is true of many magic-­using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as
clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process
varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.</p>
<p>In every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at
any given time depends on the character’s level.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="spell-slots">
<h2>Spell Slots<a class="headerlink" href="#spell-slots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Regardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can
cast only a limited number of spells before resting. Manipulating the
fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is
physically and mentally taxing, and higher-­ level spells are even more
so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the
warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell
level a character can use at each character level. For example, the
3rd-­level wizard Umara has four 1st-­level spell slots and two
2nd-­level slots.</p>
<p>When a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that spell’s
level or higher, effectively “filling” a slot with the spell. You can
think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain size—small for a
1st-­level slot, larger for a spell of higher level. A 1st-­level spell
fits into a slot of any size, but a 9th-­level spell fits only in a
9th-­level slot. So when Umara casts <em>magic missile,</em> a 1st-­level
spell, she spends one of her four 1st-­level slots and has three
remaining.</p>
<p>Finishing a long rest restores any expended spell slots.</p>
<p>Some characters and monsters have special abilities that let them cast
spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who follows the
Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain eldritch
invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all cast spells in
such a way.</p>
<div class="section" id="casting-a-spell-at-a-higher-level">
<h3>Casting a Spell at a Higher Level<a class="headerlink" href="#casting-a-spell-at-a-higher-level" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher level
than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that casting. For
instance, if Umara casts <em>magic missile</em> using one of her 2nd-­level
slots, that <em>magic missile</em> is 2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands
to fill the slot it is put into.</p>
<p>Some spells, such as <em>magic missile</em> and <em>cure wounds</em>, have more
powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a spell’s
description.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p class="rubric" id="casting-in-armor">Casting in Armor</p>
<p>Because of the mental focus and precise gestures required for
spellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing
to cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically
hampered by your armor for spellcasting.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cantrips">
<h2>Cantrips<a class="headerlink" href="#cantrips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell
slot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has fixed
the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the magic
needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell level is
0.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rituals">
<h2>Rituals<a class="headerlink" href="#rituals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Certain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast
following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as
a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast
than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual
version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.</p>
<p>To cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that
grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have
such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his
or her list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature
specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does.</p>
