Disguise Self
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level illusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You make yourself---including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other
belongings on your person--- look different until the spell ends or until
you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller
and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body
type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of
limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical
inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your
outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would
feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to
appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to
touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to
inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC.
