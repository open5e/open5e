Divination
-------------------------------------------------------------

4th-level divination (ritual)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate
to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell
consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god's
servants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event,
or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful reply. The
reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.

The spell doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that
might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or
the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long
rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the
first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this roll in secret.
