Detect Evil and Good
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level divination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial,
elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as where
the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a place or
object within 30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated or
desecrated.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of
stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood
or dirt.
