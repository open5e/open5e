Darkness
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a
15 foot radius :ref:`srd:sphere` for the duration. The darkness spreads around
corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and
nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

If the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that
isn't being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object and
moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness with an
opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a
spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is
dispelled.
