Delayed Blast Fireball
-------------------------------------------------------------

7th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then condenses
to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead for the
duration. When the spell ends, either because your concentration is
broken or because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a low
roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around corners. Each
creature in a 20 foot radius :ref:`srd:sphere` centered on that point must make a
Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total
accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

The spell's base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead has
not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.

If the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the
creature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On
a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to 40 feet. When
it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell ends, and the bead
explodes.

The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that
aren't being worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th
level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level
above 7th.
