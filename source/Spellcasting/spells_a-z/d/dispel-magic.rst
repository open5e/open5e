Dispel Magic
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell
of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or
higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting
ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check,
the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th
level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the
target if the spell's level is equal to or less than the level of the
spell slot you used.
