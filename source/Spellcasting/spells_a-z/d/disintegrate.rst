Disintegrate
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you
can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a
creation of magical force, such as the wall created by wall of force.

A creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On
a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this damage
reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying,
except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The
creature can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or
a wish spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical
object or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger
object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a 10 foot :ref:`srd:cube`
portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th
level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above
6th.
