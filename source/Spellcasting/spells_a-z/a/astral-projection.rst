Astral Projection
-------------------------------------------------------------

9th-level necromancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell,
you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately
carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell
consumes)

**Duration:** Special

You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral
bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted
if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is
:ref:`srd:unconscious` and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn't need food
or air and doesn't age.

Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way,
replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal
difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between
your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after
1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the
tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is
cut---something that can happen only when an effect specifically states
that it does---your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly.

Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass
through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new
plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your
body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you
to re enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a
separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have
no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to
it.

The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to
dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its
physical body, and it awakens.

The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A
successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body
ends the spell for that creature. If a creature's original body or its
astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If
the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the
creature's astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended
animation.

If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in
their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies,
usually by dropping to 0 hit points.
