Arcane Hand
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin glove)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an
unoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the
spell's duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements
of your own hand.

The hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit
point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a
Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn't fill
its space.

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns,
you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the following
effects with it.

**Clenched Fist.** The hand strikes one creature or object within 5
feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game
statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.

**Forceful Hand.** The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet
of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand's Strength
contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target
is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed,
the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to
five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the
target to remain within 5 feet of it.

**Grasping Hand.** The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller
creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand's Strength score to
resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have
advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can
use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target
takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability
modifier.

**Interposing Hand.** The hand interposes itself between you and a
creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The
hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half
cover against the target. The target can't move through the hand's space
if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand's Strength
score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand's Strength score,
the target can move toward you through the hand's space, but that space
is difficult terrain for the target.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th
level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by
2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot
level above 5th.
