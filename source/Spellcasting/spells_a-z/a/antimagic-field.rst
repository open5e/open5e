Antimagic Field
-------------------------------------------------------------

8th-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (10 foot radius sphere)

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A 10 foot radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area
is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within
the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even
magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with
you, centered on you.

Spells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or
a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude into it. A slot
expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is
suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it spends suppressed
counts against its duration.

***Targeted Effects.*** Spells and other magical effects, such as magic
missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the
sphere have no effect on that target.

***Areas of Magic.*** The area of another spell or magical effect, such
as fireball, can’t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an
area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is
suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are
suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap
is large enough.

***Spells.*** Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or
an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in
it.

***Magic Items.*** The properties and powers of magic items are
suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere
functions as a nonmagical longsword.

A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used
against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere.
If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere
(for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a
target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be
suppressed as soon as it exits.

***Magical Travel.*** Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in
the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point
for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane
of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as
that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the
sphere.

***Creatures and Objects.*** A creature or object summoned or created by
magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature
instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer
within the sphere.

***Dispel Magic.*** Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have
no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different
antimagic field spells don’t nullify each other.
