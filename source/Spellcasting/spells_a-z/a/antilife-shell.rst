Antilife Shell
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** self (10 foot radius) Components: V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

A shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10 foot radius and moves
with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out creatures other than
undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for the duration.

The barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching
through. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with
ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.

If you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through the
barrier, the spell ends.
