Acid Arrow
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder's stomach)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts
in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a
hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at
the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with
acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of
its next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd
level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4
for each slot level above 2nd.
