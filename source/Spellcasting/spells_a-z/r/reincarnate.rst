Reincarnate
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp,
which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that
the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new
adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that body.

If the target's soul isn't free or willing to do so, the spell fails.

The magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which likely
causes the creature's race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and consults
the following table to determine what form the creature takes when
restored to life, or the GM chooses a form.

The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It
retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it
exchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial
traits accordingly.
