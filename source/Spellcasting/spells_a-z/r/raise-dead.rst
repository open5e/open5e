Raise Dead
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level necromancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 500 gp, which the
spell consumes)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been
dead no longer than 10 days. If the creature's soul is both willing and
at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit
point.

This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases
that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell doesn't,
however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these
aren't first removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when
the creature returns to life. The spell can't return an undead creature
to life.

This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body
parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its
survival---its head, for instance---the spell automatically fails.

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to
all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the
target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it
disappears.
