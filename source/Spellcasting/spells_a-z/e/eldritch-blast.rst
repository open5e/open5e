Evocation cantrip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature within range.
Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 force damage.
The spell creates more than one beam when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level,
three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct the beams
at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.
