Storm of Vengeance
-------------------------------------------------------------

9th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Sight

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and
spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area,
thunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no
more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6
thunder damage and becomes :ref:`srd:deafened` for 5 minutes.

Each round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces
additional effects on your turn.

**Round 2.** Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and
object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.

**Round 3.** You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike
six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A given
creature or object can't be struck by more than one bolt. A struck
creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d6
lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

**Round 4.** Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under
the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.

**Round 5-10.** Gusts and freezing rain assail the area under the
cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured. Each
creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area
are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the
purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of
strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically
disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane
or magical.
