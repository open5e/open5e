Stone Shape
-------------------------------------------------------------

4th-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly
the desired shape of the stone object)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone
no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that
suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a
weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long
as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door
or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to
two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.
