Sunburst
-------------------------------------------------------------

8th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60 foot radius centered on a point you
choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6
radiant damage and is :ref:`srd:blinded` for 1 minute. On a successful save, it
takes half as much damage and isn't :ref:`srd:blinded` by this spell. Undead and
oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature :ref:`srd:blinded` by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw
at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer
:ref:`srd:blinded`.

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
