**Casting Time:** 1 action

You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts
for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited
by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information
about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can
perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to
persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the GM's
discretion.
