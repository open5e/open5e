Suggestion
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level enchantment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, M (a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or
a drop of sweet oil)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and
magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear
and understand you. Creatures that can't be :ref:`srd:charmed` are immune to this
effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the
course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself,
throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously
harmful act ends the spell.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues
the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The
suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the
suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends
when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity
during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give
her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met
before the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.
