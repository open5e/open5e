Scrying
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level divination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the
same plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving
throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of
physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you're casting
this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be
observed.

On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this
spell against it again for 24 hours.

On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet
of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor as if you were
there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it
for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the
sensor as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen
before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor appears at
that location and doesn't move.
