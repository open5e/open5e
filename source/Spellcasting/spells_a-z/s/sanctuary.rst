Sanctuary
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a small silver mirror)

**Duration:** 1 minute

You ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell ends,
any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or a harmful
spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or spell. This
spell doesn't protect the warded creature from area effects, such as the
explosion of a fireball.

If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects an
enemy creature, this spell ends.
