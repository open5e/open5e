Sunbeam
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (60 foot line) Components: V, S, M (a magnifying glass)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5 foot wide,
60 foot long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and
is :ref:`srd:blinded` until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as
much damage and isn't :ref:`srd:blinded` by this spell. Undead and oozes have
disadvantage on this saving throw.

You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until
the spell ends.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It
sheds bright light in a 30 foot radius and dim light for an additional
30 feet. This light is sunlight.
