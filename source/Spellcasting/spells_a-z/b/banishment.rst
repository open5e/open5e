Banishment
-------------------------------------------------------------

4th-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (an item distasteful to the

target)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to
another plane of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving
throw or be banished.

If the target is native to the plane of existence you're on, you banish
the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is
:ref:`srd:incapacitated`. The target remains there until the spell ends, at which
point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest
unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one
you're on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning
to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the
target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space
if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn't return.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th
level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot
level above 4th.
