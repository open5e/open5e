Black Tentacles
-------------------------------------------------------------

4th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of tentacle from a giant octopus or a
giant squid)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20 foot square on ground that you can
see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in
the area into difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or
starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving
throw or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be :ref:`srd:restrained` by the tentacles
until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is
already :ref:`srd:restrained` by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage.

A creature :ref:`srd:restrained` by the tentacles can use its action to make a
Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On
a success, it frees itself.
