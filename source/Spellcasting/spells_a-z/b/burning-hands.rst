Burning Hands
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** self (15 foot :ref:`srd:cone`) Components: V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin
sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each
creature in a 15 foot :ref:`srd:cone` must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being
worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
1st.
