3rd-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 minute

Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the
spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of
existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the
casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of
your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal
Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see
within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is
available within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space
(chosen at random if more than one space is equally near). You can
dismiss this spell as an action.

While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you
originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can't see
anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be
affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren't
there can't perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the
ability to do so.
