Unseen Servant
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level conjuration (ritual)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of string and a bit of wood)

**Duration:** 1 hour

This spell creates an :ref:`srd:invisible`, mindless, shapeless force that performs
simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The servant springs
into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has
AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it
drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.

Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command
the servant to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The
servant can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as
fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires,
serving food, and pouring wine. Once you give the command, the servant
performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the
task, then waits for your next command.

If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more
than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.
