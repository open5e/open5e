Telekinesis
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by
thought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the
duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can
see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect
the same target round after round, or choose a new one at any time. If
you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell.

\*\*Creature.\_\*\* You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make
an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the
creature's Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature
up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the
range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is
:ref:`srd:restrained` in your telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is
suspended in mid air.

On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain
your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.

\*\*Object.\_\*\* You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000
pounds. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically
move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of this
spell.

If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability
check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature's
Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that
creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond
the range of this spell.

You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such
as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or
retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from
a vial.
