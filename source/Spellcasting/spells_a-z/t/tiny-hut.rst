Tiny Hut
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level evocation (ritual)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self (10 foot radius :ref:`hemisphere <srd:sphere>`)

**Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal bead)

**Duration:** 8 hours

A 10 foot radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around
and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if
you leave its area.

Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with
you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than
nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this
spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are
barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can't
extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the
space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.

Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly lit
or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you choose,
but it is transparent from the inside.
