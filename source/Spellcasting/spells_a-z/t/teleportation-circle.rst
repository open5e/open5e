Teleportation Circle
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 10 feet

**Components:** V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems
with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** 1 round

As you cast the spell, you draw a 10 foot diameter circle on the ground
inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent
teleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know and
that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering portal opens
within the circle you drew and remains open until the end of your next
turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly appears within 5
feet of the destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if
that space is occupied.

Many major temples, guilds, and other important places have permanent
teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their confines. Each
such circle includes a unique sigil sequence---a string of magical runes
arranged in a particular pattern. When you first gain the ability to
cast this spell, you learn the sigil sequences for two destinations on
the Material Plane, determined by the GM. You can learn additional sigil
sequences during your adventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to
memory after studying it for 1 minute.

You can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this spell in
the same location every day for one year. You need not use the circle to
teleport when you cast the spell in this way.
