Thunderwave
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** self (15 foot :ref:`srd:cube`)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15
foot :ref:`srd:cube` originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On
a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet
away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much
damage and isn't pushed.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of
effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's
effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
1st.
