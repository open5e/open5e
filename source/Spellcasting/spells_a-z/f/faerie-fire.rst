**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each object in a 20 foot :ref:`srd:cube` within range is outlined in blue, green,
or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell
is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw.
For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10
foot radius.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if
the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't
benefit from being :ref:`srd:invisible`.
