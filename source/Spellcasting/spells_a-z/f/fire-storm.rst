Fire Storm
-------------------------------------------------------------

7th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you
choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10 foot
:ref:`cubes <srd:cube>`, which you can arrange as you wish. Each :ref:`srd:cube` must have at least
one face adjacent to the face of another :ref:`srd:cube`. Each creature in the area
must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that
aren't being worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in the area is
unaffected by this spell.
