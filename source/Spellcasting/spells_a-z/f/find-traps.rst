Find Traps
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level divination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of
sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that
would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or
undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by its creator.
Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph
of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural
weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don't learn the
location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger
posed by a trap you sense.
