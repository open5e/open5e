Forcecage
-------------------------------------------------------------

7th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 100 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)

**Duration:** 1 hour

An immobile, invisible, :ref:`srd:cube` shaped prison composed of magical force
springs into existence around an area you choose within range. The
prison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.

A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and is
made from 1/2 inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.

A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating
a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and
blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.

When you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the
cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or
those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the center
of the area until they are completely outside the area.

A creature inside the cage can't leave it by nonmagical means. If the
creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the
cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the
creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature
can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage
also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

This spell can't be dispelled by dispel magic.
