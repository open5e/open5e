Fireball
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose
within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of
flame. Each creature in a 20 foot radius :ref:`srd:sphere` centered on that point
must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the
area that aren't being worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above
3rd.
