Irresistible Dance
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level enchantment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a
comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the
duration. Creatures that can't be :ref:`srd:charmed` are immune to this spell.

A dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without leaving
its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and attack
rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other creatures have
advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing creature
makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful
save, the spell ends.
