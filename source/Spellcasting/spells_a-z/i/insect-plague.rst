Insect Plague
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 300 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain,
and a smear of fat)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20 foot radius :ref:`srd:sphere` centered on a
point you choose within range. The :ref:`srd:sphere` spreads around corners. The
:ref:`srd:sphere` remains for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The
sphere's area is difficult terrain.

When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution
saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this
saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a
turn or ends its turn there.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above
5th.
