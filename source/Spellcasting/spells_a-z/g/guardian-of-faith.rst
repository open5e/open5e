Guardian of Faith
-----------------

4th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V 

**Duration:** 8 hours

A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers for the duration in an unoccupied space
of your choice that you can see within range. The guardian occupies that space
and is indistinct except for a gleaming sword and shield emblazoned with the symbol
of your deity. Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within 10 feet of
the guardian for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw.
The creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60 damage.
