Guards and Wards
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone
and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a
small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space
(an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5 foot squares or twenty five 10
foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as
you desire. You can ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the
area among them, as long as you can walk into each contiguous area while
you are casting the spell.

When you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are
unaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can also
specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to
these effects.

Guards and wards creates the following effects within the warded area.

**Corridors.** Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them heavily
obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching passage
offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance that a
creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite
direction from the one it chooses.

**Doors.** All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as if
sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten
doors with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of
the minor illusion spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall.

**Stairs.** Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to
bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow in 10 minutes if they are
burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts.

**Other Spell Effect.** You can place your choice of one of the
following magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.

-  Place dancing lights in four corridors. You can designate a simple
   program that the lights repeat as long as guards and wards lasts.
-  Place magic mouth in two locations.
-  Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors appear in the
   places you designate; they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by
   wind while guards and wards lasts.
-  Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room.
-  Place a suggestion in one location. You select an area of up to 5
   feet square, and any creature that enters or passes through the area
   receives the suggestion mentally.

The whole warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on a specific
effect, if successful, removes only that effect.

You can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting
this spell there every day for one year.
