Transmutation cantrip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)

**Duration:** 1 round

You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a
message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can
reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with
the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of
stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood
blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and
can travel freely around corners or through openings.
