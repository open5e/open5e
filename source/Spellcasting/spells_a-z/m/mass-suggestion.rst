Mass Suggestion
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level enchantment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, M (a snake's tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or
a drop of sweet oil)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and
magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can
see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that
can't be :ref:`srd:charmed` are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be
worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound
reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw itself onto a
spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act
automatically negates the effect of the spell.

Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it
pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability.
The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If
the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell
ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity
during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of
soldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the
condition isn't met before the spell ends, the activity isn't performed.

If you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this
spell, the spell ends for that creature.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell
slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the
duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration
is a year and a day.
