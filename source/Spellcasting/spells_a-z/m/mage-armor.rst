Mage Armor
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)

**Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and a protective
magical force surrounds it until the spell ends. The target's base AC
becomes 13 + its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends if the target dons
armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.
