Minor Illusion
-------------------------------------------------------------

Illusion cantrip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece)

**Duration:** 1 minute

You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for
the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or
cast this spell again.

If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream.
It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of
drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated
throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different
times before the spell ends.

If you create an image of an object---such as a chair, muddy footprints,
or a small chest---it must be no larger than a 5 foot :ref:`srd:cube`. The image
can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical
interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things
can pass through it.

If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the
creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes
faint to the creature.
