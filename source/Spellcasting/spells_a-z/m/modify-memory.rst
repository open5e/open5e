Modify Memory
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level enchantment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to reshape another creature's memories. One creature that
you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the
creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the
target becomes :ref:`srd:charmed` by you for the duration. The charmed target is
:ref:`srd:incapacitated` and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear
you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell
ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.

While this charm lasts, you can affect the target's memory of an event
that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more
than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event,
allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting
detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a
memory of some other event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected,
and it must be able to understand your language for the modified
memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your
description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the
modified memories, the creature's memory isn't altered. Otherwise, the
modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a creature behaves,
particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural
inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such
as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself
in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might deem a
modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant
manner.

A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on the target restores
the creature's true memory.

**At Higher Levels.** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th
level or higher, you can alter the target's memories of an event that
took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year
ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level).
