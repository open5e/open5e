Moonbeam
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece
of opalescent feldspar)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5 foot radius, 40 foot
high :ref:`srd:cylinder` centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends,
dim light fills the :ref:`srd:cylinder`.

When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or
starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause
searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes
2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it
also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different
form until it leaves the spell's light.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action
to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above
2nd.
