Mirage Arcane
-------------------------------------------------------------

7th-level illusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Sight

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 days

You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and
even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain's general shape
remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to
resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable
terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice
like a gentle slope, or a rock strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.

Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where
none are present. The spell doesn't disguise, conceal, or add creatures.

The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements,
so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or
otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory
terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell's area
disappears immediately.

Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain's
true form; however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while
the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still
physically interact with the illusion.
