Mending
-------------------------------------------------------------

Transmutation cantrip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such
as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a
leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot
in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the
spell can't restore magic to such an object.
