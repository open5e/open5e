Meteor Swarm
-------------------------------------------------------------

9th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 1 mile

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you
can see within range. Each creature in a 40 foot radius :ref:`srd:sphere` centered
on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The :ref:`srd:sphere`
spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire damage and 20d6
bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is
affected only once.

The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that
aren't being worn or carried.
