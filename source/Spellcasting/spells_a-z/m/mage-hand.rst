A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range.

you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to
manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or
retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a
vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10
