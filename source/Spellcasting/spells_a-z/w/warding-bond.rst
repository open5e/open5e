Warding Bond
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp
each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)

**Duration:** 1 hour

This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic
connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the
target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving
throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes
damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target
become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast
again on either of the connected creatures. You can also dismiss the
spell as an action.
