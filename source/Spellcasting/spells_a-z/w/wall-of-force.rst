Wall of Force
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear
gemstone)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose
within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a
horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating
or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome
or a :ref:`srd:sphere` with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat
surface made up of ten 10 foot by 10 foot panels. Each panel must be
contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick.
It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space
when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your
choice which side).

Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage
and can't be dispelled by dispel magic. A disintegrate spell destroys
the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal
Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.
