Weird
-------------------------------------------------------------

9th-level illusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to one minute

Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create
illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature
in a 30 foot radius :ref:`srd:sphere` centered on a point of your choice within
range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
becomes :ref:`srd:frightened` for the duration. The illusion calls on the
creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an
implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature's
turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic
damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
