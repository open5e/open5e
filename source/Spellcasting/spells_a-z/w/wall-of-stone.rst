Wall of Stone
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a small block of granite)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point you
choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of ten
10 foot by 10 foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with at least
one other panel. Alternatively, you can create 10 foot by 20 foot panels
that are only 3 inches thick.

If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the
creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a creature
would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another
solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
success, it can use its reaction to move up to its speed so that it is
no longer enclosed by the wall.

The wall can have any shape you desire, though it can't occupy the same
space as a creature or object. The wall doesn't need to be vertical or
rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge with and be solidly
supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use this spell to bridge a
chasm or create a ramp.

If you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the
size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to
create crenellations, battlements, and so on.

The wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus
breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of thickness.
Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might cause connected
panels to collapse at the GM's discretion.

If you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole duration,
the wall becomes permanent and can't be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall
disappears when the spell ends.
