Protection from Evil and Good
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which
the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Concentration up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected
against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals,
fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have
disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't
be :ref:`srd:charmed`, :ref:`srd:frightened`, or possessed by them. If the target is already
:ref:`srd:charmed`, :ref:`srd:frightened`, or possessed by such a creature, the target has
advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
