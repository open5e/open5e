Conjuration cantrip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the
duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds
bright light in a 10 foot radius and dim light for an additional 10
feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it
again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell.
When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl
the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell
attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8),
11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
