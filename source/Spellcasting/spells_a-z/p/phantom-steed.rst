Phantom Steed
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level illusion (ritual)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

A Large quasi real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an
unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's
appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of
the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is
carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The
creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed
of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast
pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1
minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or
if the steed takes any damage.
