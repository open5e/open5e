^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and
create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to
that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
save, the target becomes :ref:`srd:frightened` for the duration. At the end of each
of the target's turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on
a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save,
the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above
4th.
