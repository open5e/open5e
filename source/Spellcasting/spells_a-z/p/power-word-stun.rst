Power Word Stun
-------------------------------------------------------------

8th-level enchantment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature
you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150
hit points or fewer, it is :ref:`srd:stunned`. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The :ref:`srd:stunned` target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of
each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.
