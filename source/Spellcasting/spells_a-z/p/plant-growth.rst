Plant Growth
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action or 8 hours

**Range:** 150 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There
are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long
term benefits.

If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All
normal plants in a 100 foot radius centered on that point become thick
and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of
movement for every 1 foot it moves.

You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell's area
from being affected.

If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants in
a half mile radius centered on a point within range become enriched for
1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.
