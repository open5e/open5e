Planar Binding
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the
spell consumes)

**Duration:** 24 hours

With this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a fey,
or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range for the
entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is first summoned
into the center of an inverted magic circle in order to keep it trapped
while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the casting, the target
must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it is bound to
serve you for the duration. If the creature was summoned or created by
another spell, that spell's duration is extended to match the duration
of this spell.

A bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its
ability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an
adventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The creature
obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature is hostile to
you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own objectives. If
the creature carries out your instructions completely before the spell
ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you are on the same plane
of existence. If you are on a different plane of existence, it returns
to the place where you bound it and remains there until the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of a
higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a #### 6th-level
slot, to 30 days with a 7th level slot, to 180 days with an 8th level
slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th level spell slot.
