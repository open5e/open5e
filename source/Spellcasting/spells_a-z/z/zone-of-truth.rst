Zone of Truth
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level enchantment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 10 minutes

You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15 foot
radius :ref:`srd:sphere` centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the
spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time
on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On
a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the
radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving
throw.

An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering
questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature
can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains within the
boundaries of the truth.
