Contingency
-------------------------------------------------------------

6th-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and
decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)

**Duration:** 10 days

Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a
casting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that
spell---called the contingent spell---as part of casting contingency,
expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come
into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain circumstance
occurs. You describe that circumstance when you cast the two spells. For
example, a contingency cast with water breathing might stipulate that
water breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a
similar liquid.

The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance is
met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then
contingency ends.

The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally
target others. You can use only one contingency spell at a time. If you
cast this spell again, the effect of another contingency spell on you
ends. Also, contingency ends on you if its material component is ever
not on your person.
