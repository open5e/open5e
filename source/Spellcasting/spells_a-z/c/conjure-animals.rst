Conjure Animals
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts and appear in
unoccupied spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the
following options for what appears:

-  One beast of challenge rating 2 or lower
-  Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower
-  Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
-  Eight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower

Each beast is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops
to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll
initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own
turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action
required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend
themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

The GM has the creatures' statistics.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using certain higher
level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and
more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th level slot, three times
as many with a 7th level slot, and four times as many with a 9th level
slot.
