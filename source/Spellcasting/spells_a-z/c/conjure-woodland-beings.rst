Conjure Woodland Beings
-------------------------------------------------------------

4th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (one holly berry per creature summoned)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You summon fey creatures that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can
see within range. Choose one of the following options for what appears:

-  One fey creature of challenge rating 2 or lower
-  Two fey creatures of challenge rating 1 or lower
-  Four fey creatures of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
-  Eight fey creatures of challenge rating 1/4 or lower

A summoned creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the
spell ends.

The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll
initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which have their own
turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action
required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend
themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

The GM has the creatures' statistics.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using certain higher
level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and
more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th level slot and three
times as many with an 8th level slot.
