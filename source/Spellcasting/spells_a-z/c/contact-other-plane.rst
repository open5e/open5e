Contact Other Plane
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level divination (ritual)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** 1 minute

You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long dead sage, or some
other mysterious entity from

another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or
even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15
Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and
are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can't take
actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and
speak only in gibberish. A greater restoration spell cast on you ends
this effect.

On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You
must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each
question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never,"
"irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the
question). If a one word answer would be misleading, the GM might
instead offer a short phrase as an answer.
