Contagion
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level necromancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Component:** V, S

**Duration:** 7 days

Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a
creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with a
disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.

At the end of each of the target's turns, it must make a Constitution
saving throw. After failing three of these saving throws, the disease's
effects last for the duration, and the creature stops making these
saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the creature
recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.

Since this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect
that removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease's effects
apply to it.

**Blinding Sickness.** Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes
turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and
Wisdom saving throws and is :ref:`srd:blinded`.

**Filth Fever.** A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body.
The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving
throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.

**Flesh Rot.** The creature's flesh decays. The creature has
disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage.

**Mindfire.** The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has
disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and
the creature behaves as if under the effects of the confusion spell
during combat.

**Seizure.** The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has
disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack
rolls that use Dexterity.

**Slimy Doom.** The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The
creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving
throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is :ref:`srd:stunned`
until the end of its next turn.
