Clone
-------------------------------------------------------------

8th-level necromancy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 hour

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp and at least
1 cubic inch of flesh of the creature that is to be cloned, which the
spell consumes, and a vessel worth at least 2,000 gp that has a sealable
lid and is large enough to hold a Medium creature, such as a huge urn,
coffin, mud filled cyst in the ground, or crystal container filled with
salt water)

**Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard
against death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full
size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone
be a younger version of the same creature. It remains inert and endures
indefinitely, as long as its vessel remains undisturbed.

At any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies, its
soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and willing
to return.

The clone is physically identical to the original and has the same
personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original's
equipment. The original creature's physical remains, if they still
exist, become inert and can't thereafter be restored to life, since the
creature's soul is elsewhere.
