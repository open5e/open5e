Calm Emotions
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level enchantment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each
humanoid in a 20 foot radius :ref:`srd:sphere` centered on a point you choose
within range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to
fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving
throw, choose one of the following two effects.

You can suppress any effect causing a target to be :ref:`srd:charmed` or
:ref:`srd:frightened`. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes,
provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.

Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your
choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target
is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends
being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again,
unless the GM rules otherwise.
