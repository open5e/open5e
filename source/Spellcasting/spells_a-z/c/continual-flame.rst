Continual Flame
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level evocation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell
consumes)

**Duration:** Until dispelled

A flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an
object that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it
creates no heat and doesn't use oxygen. A continual flame can be covered
or hidden but not smothered or quenched.
