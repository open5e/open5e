Confusion
-------------------------------------------------------------

4th-level enchantment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (three nut shells)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and
provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10 foot radius :ref:`srd:sphere`
centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start
of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

+------+------------+
| d10  | Behavior   |
+======+============+
| 1    | The        |
|      | creature   |
|      | uses all   |
|      | its        |
|      | movement   |
|      | to move in |
|      | a random   |
|      | direction. |
|      | To         |
|      | determine  |
|      | the        |
|      | direction, |
|      | roll a d8  |
|      | and assign |
|      | a          |
|      | direction  |
|      | to each    |
|      | die face.  |
|      | The        |
|      | creature   |
|      | doesn't    |
|      | take an    |
|      | action     |
|      | this turn. |
+------+------------+
| 2-6  | The        |
|      | creature   |
|      | doesn't    |
|      | move or    |
|      | take       |
|      | actions    |
|      | this turn. |
+------+------------+
| 7-8  | The        |
|      | creature   |
|      | uses its   |
|      | action to  |
|      | make a     |
|      | melee      |
|      | attack     |
|      | against a  |
|      | randomly   |
|      | determined |
|      | creature   |
|      | within its |
|      | reach. If  |
|      | there is   |
|      | no         |
|      | creature   |
|      | within its |
|      | reach, the |
|      | creature   |
|      | does       |
|      | nothing    |
|      | this turn. |
+------+------------+
| 9-10 | The        |
|      | creature   |
|      | can act    |
|      | and move   |
|      | normally.  |
+------+------------+

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom
saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th
level or higher, the radius of the :ref:`srd:sphere` increases by 5 feet for each
slot level above 4th.
