Call Lightning
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A storm cloud appears in the shape of a :ref:`srd:cylinder` that is 10 feet tall
with a 60 foot radius, centered on a point you can see 100 feet directly
above you. The spell fails if you can't see a point in the air where the
storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can't
accommodate the cloud).

When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt
of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature
within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until the spell ends,
you can use your action to call down lightning in this way again,
targeting the same point or a different one.

If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the
spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of creating a
new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by 1d10.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th
or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above
3rd.
