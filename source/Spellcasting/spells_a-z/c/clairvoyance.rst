Clairvoyance
-------------------------------------------------------------

3rd-level divination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** 1 mile

**Components:** V, S, M (a focus worth at least 100 gp, either a jeweled
horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to
you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location
that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in
a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it
can't be attacked or otherwise interacted with.

When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use the
chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your
action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.

A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from
see invisibility or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the
size of your fist.
