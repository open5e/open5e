Counterspell
------------

3rd-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell.
If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect.
If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability.
The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails and has no effect.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher,
the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of
the spell slot you used.
