Control Water
-------------------------------------------------------------

4th-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 300 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area
you choose that is a :ref:`srd:cube` up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from
any of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on
your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.

**Flood.** You cause the water level of all standing water in the area
to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the
flooding water spills over onto dry land.

If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20
foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and
then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are
carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck
by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.

The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a
different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on
the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.

**Part Water.** You cause water in the area to move apart and create a
trench. The trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated
water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until the spell
ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly fills in
the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water
level is restored.

**Redirect Flow.** You cause flowing water in the area to move in a
direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up
walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as
you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its
flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the
direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different
effect.

**Whirlpool.** This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet
square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of
the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base,
up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object
in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward
it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength
(Athletics) check against your spell save DC.

When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts
its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex
until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half
damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex
can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described
above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.

The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object
takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains
in the vortex.
