Color Spray
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level illusion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (15 foot :ref:`srd:cone`)

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is colored red,
yellow, and blue)

**Duration:** 1 round

A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll
6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can
effect. Creatures in a 15 foot :ref:`srd:cone` originating from you are affected in
ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious
creatures and creatures that can't see).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each
creature affected by this spell is :ref:`srd:blinded` until the spell ends.
Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to
the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points
must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to
be affected.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd
level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.
