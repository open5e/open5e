Comprehend Languages
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level divination (ritual)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)

**Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken
language that you hear. You also understand any written language that
you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are
written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This spell doesn't decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as
an arcane sigil, that isn't part of a written language.
