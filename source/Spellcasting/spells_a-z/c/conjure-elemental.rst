Conjure Elemental
-------------------------------------------------------------

5th-level conjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 90 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (burning incense for air, soft clay for earth,
sulfur and phosphorus for fire, or water and sand for water)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire,
or water that fills a 10 foot :ref:`srd:cube` within range. An elemental of
challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in
an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental
emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises up from the ground.
The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell
ends.

The elemental is friendly to you and your companions for the duration.
Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its own turns. It obeys any
verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you
don't issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself from
hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

If your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn't disappear.
Instead, you lose control of the elemental, it becomes hostile toward
you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental
can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned
it.

The GM has the elemental's statistics.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th
level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level
above 5th.
