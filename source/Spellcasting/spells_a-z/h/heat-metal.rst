Heat Metal
-------------------------------------------------------------

2nd-level transmutation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of iron and a flame)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of
heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause
the object to glow red hot. Any creature in physical contact with the
object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell
ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to
cause this damage again.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from
it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the
object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has disadvantage on
attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd
level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above
2nd.
