Holy Aura
-------------------------------------------------------------

8th-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a tiny reliquary worth at least 1,000 gp
containing a sacred relic, such as a scrap of cloth from a saint's robe
or a piece of parchment from a religious text)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in a
30 foot radius around you. Creatures of your choice in that radius when
you cast this spell shed dim light in a 5 foot radius and have advantage
on all saving throws, and other creatures have disadvantage on attack
rolls against them until the spell ends. In addition, when a fiend or an
undead hits an affected creature with a melee attack, the aura flashes
with brilliant light. The attacker must succeed on a Constitution saving
throw or be :ref:`srd:blinded` until the spell ends.
