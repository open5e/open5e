Hideous Laughter
-------------------------------------------------------------

1st-level enchantment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 30 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (tiny tarts and a feather that is waved in the
air)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A creature of your choice that you can see within range perceives
everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this
spell affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
fall :ref:`srd:prone`, becoming :ref:`srd:incapacitated` and unable to stand up for the
duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn't
affected.

At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the
target can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on
the saving throw if it's triggered by damage. On a success, the spell
ends.
