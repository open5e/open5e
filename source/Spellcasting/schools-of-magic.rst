The Schools of Magic
--------------------

Academies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of
magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all
spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way,
whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.

The schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their
own, although some rules refer to the schools.

**Abjuration** spells are protective in nature, though some of them have
aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects,
harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.

**Conjuration** spells involve the transportation of objects and
creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or
objects to the caster's side, whereas others allow the caster to
teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or
effects out of nothing.

**Divination** spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets
long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things,
the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.

**Enchantment** spells affect the minds of others, influencing or
controlling their behavior. Such spells can make enemies see the caster
as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control
another creature like a puppet.

**Evocation** spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired
effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel
positive energy to heal wounds.

**Illusion** spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause
people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there,
to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some
illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most
insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.

**Necromancy** spells manipulate the energies of life and death. Such
spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy
from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to
life.

Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as
*animate dead* is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells
frequently.

**Transmutation** spells change the properties of a creature, object, or
environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster
the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster's command, or
enhance a creature's innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from
injury.
