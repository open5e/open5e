Saving Throws
-------------

A saving throw---also called a save---represents an attempt to resist a
spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't
normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one
because your character or monster is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability
modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity
saving throw.

A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can
be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard,
for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill
proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or
her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability
score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well. The
Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that
causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is
determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in
the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a
creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.
