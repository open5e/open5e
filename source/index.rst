Open5e
======

Open5e aims to be the best open-source resource for 5th edition d20 content.

What are we about?
------------------

In addition to an open, readable, and easily searchable resource for the 5e SRD we have lots of new things we'd like to add! At the top of our list are:

.. rst-class:: list-bulleted

* **Machine-readable data** like monsters and spell lists, in formats like **csv, json, md, and xml**
* **Useful tools** such as **random tables, encounter calculators, treasure generators, And more...**
* Plus the best **OGL community-created** content on the web!
