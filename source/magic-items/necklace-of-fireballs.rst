Necklace of Fireballs
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rare*

This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action
to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the
end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-­level *fireball*
spell (save DC 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action.
When you do so, increase the level of the *fireball* by 1 for each bead
beyond the first.
