Potion of Invisibility
------------------------------------------------------


*Potion, very rare*

This potion’s container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid.
When you drink it, you become invisible for 1 hour. Anything you wear or
carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast
a spell.
