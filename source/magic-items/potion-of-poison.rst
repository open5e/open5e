Potion of Poison
------------------------------------------------------


*Potion, uncommon*

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a *potion of healing* or
other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by
illusion magic. An *identify* spell reveals its true nature.

If you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a
DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of
your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison
damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving
throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your
subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage
decreases to 0.
