Staff of Healing
------------------------------------------------------


*Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, or druid)*

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from
it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: *cure
wounds* (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), *lesser restoration* (2
charges), or *mass cure wounds* (5 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff vanishes in a flash of
light, lost forever.

Staff of Power
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or
wizard)*

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus
to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2
bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains
2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge,
roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage
rolls but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2
charges.

**Power Strike.** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff,
you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.

**Spells.** While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend
1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it,
using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: *cone of cold* (5
charges), *fireball* (5th-­level version, 5 charges), *globe of
invulnerability* (6 charges), *hold monster* (5 charges), *levitate* (2
charges), *lightning bolt* (5th-­level version, 5 charges), *magic
missile* (1 charge), *ray of enfeeblement* (1 charge), or *wall of
force* (5 charges).

**Retributive Strike.** You can use an action to break the staff over
your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike.
The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion
that expands to fill a 30-­foot-­radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of
existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you
take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff.
Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on
how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following
table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

**Distance from Origin Damage**

10 ft. away or closer 8 × the number of charges in the staff 11 to 20
ft. away 6 × the number of charges in the staff 21 to 30 ft. away 4 ×
the number of charges in the staff
