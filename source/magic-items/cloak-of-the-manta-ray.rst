Cloak of the Manta Ray
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

While wearing this cloak with its hood up, you can breathe underwater,
and you have a swimming speed of 60 feet. Pulling the hood up or down
requires an action.

Crystal Ball
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Wondrous item, very rare or legendary (requires attunement)*

The typical *crystal ball*, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in
diameter. While touching it, you can cast the *scrying* spell (save DC
17) with it.

The following *crystal ball* variants are legendary items and have
additional properties.

**Crystal Ball of Mind Reading.** You can use an action to cast the
*detect thoughts* spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the
*crystal ball*, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the
spell’s sensor. You don’t need to concentrate on this *detect thoughts*
to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* ends.

**Crystal Ball of Telepathy.** While scrying with the crystal ball,
you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30
feet of the spell’s sensor. You can also use an action to cast the
*suggestion* spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those
creatures. You don’t need to concentrate on this *suggestion* to
maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* ends. Once
used, the *suggestion* power of the *crystal ball* can’t be used again
until the next dawn.

**Crystal Ball of True Seeing.** While scrying with
the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered
on the spell’s sensor.

Cube of Force
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on
it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains
1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.

You can use an action to press one of the cube’s faces, expending a
number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of
Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has
insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of
invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a
side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1
minute, until you use an action to press the cube’s sixth face, or the
cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier’s effect by
pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number
of charges, resetting the duration.

If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid
object that can’t pass through the cube, you can’t move any closer to
that object as long as the barrier remains.
