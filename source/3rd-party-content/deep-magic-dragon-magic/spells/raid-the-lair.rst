Raid the Lair
-------------

4th-level abjuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*bard, ranger, wizard*

**Casting Time:** 10 minutes

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a piece of the dragon whose lair you are raiding)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create an invisible circle of protective energy
centered on yourself with a radius of 10 feet. This
field moves with you. The caster and all allies within
the energy field are protected against dragons’ lair
actions.

* Attack rolls resulting directly from lair actions are
  made with disadvantage.
* Saving throws resulting directly from lair actions
  are made with advantage, and damage done by these
  lair actions is halved.
* Lair actions occur on an initiative count 10 lower
  than normal.

The caster has advantage on Constitution saving
throws to maintain concentration on this spell.
