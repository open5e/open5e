Lair Sense
----------

2nd-level divination (ritual)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*wizard*

**Casting Time:** 1 minute

**Range:** 120 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (treasure worth at least 500 gp, which is not consumed in casting)

**Duration:** 24 hours

You set up a magical boundary around your lair. The
boundary can’t exceed the dimensions of a 100-foot
cube, but within that maximum, you can shape it as
you like—to follow the walls of a building or cave,
for example. While the spell lasts, you instantly
become aware of any Tiny or larger creature that
enters the enclosed area. You know the creature’s type
but nothing else about it. You are also aware when
creatures leave the area.

This awareness is enough to wake you from sleep,
and you receive the knowledge as long as you’re on
the same plane of existence as your lair.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using
a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, add 50 feet to the
maximum dimensions of the cube and add 12 hours
to the spell’s duration for each slot level above 2nd.
