Converse with Dragon
--------------------

1st-level divination
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*bard, cleric, ranger, sorcerer, wizard*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You gain limited telepathy, allowing you to
communicate with any creature within 120 feet of you
that has the dragon type, regardless of the creature’s
languages. A dragon can choose to make a Charisma
saving throw to prevent telepathic contact with itself.

This spell doesn’t change a dragon’s disposition
toward you or your allies, it only opens a channel of
communication. In some cases, unwanted telepathic
contact can worsen the dragon’s attitude toward you.
