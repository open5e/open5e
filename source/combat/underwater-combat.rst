Underwater Combat
-----------------

When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea homes, fight off
sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded dungeon
room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the
following rules apply.

When making a **melee weapon attack**, a creature
that doesn't have a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic)
has disadvantage on the attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger,
javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.

A **ranged weapon attack** automatically misses a
target beyond the weapon's normal range. Even against a target within
normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a
crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a
spear, trident, or dart).

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance
to fire damage.
