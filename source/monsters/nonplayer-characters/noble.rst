**Parry**: The noble adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that
would hit it. To do so, the noble must see the attacker and be wielding
a melee weapon.

Nobles wield great authority and influence as members of the upper
class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful
as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of
guards, as well as servants who are commoners.

The noble's statistics can also be used to represent courtiers who
aren't of noble birth.
