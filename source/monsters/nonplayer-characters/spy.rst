Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The spy makes two melee attacks.

**Shortsword**: *Melee

piercing damage.

Rulers, nobles, merchants, guildmasters, and other wealthy individuals
use **spies** to gain the upper hand in a world of cutthroat politics. A
spy is trained to secretly gather information. Loyal spies would rather
die than divulge information that could compromise them or their
employers.
