Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The gladiator makes three melee attacks or two ranged
attacks.

ft. and range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit*: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing
damage, or 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a
melee attack.

**Shield Bash**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5
ft., one creature. *Hit*: 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target
is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength
saving throw or be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Parry**: The gladiator adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that
would hit it. To do so, the gladiator must see the attacker and be
wielding a melee weapon.

Gladiators battle for the entertainment of raucous crowds. Some
gladiators are brutal pit fighters who treat each match as a
life-or-death struggle, while others are professional duelists who
command huge fees but rarely fight to the death.
