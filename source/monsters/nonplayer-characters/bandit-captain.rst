Reactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Parry**: The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that
would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be
wielding a melee weapon.

It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to
keep a gang of bandits in line. The **bandit captain** has these
qualities in spades.

In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the **pirate
captain** is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect
and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards
and punishment on a regular basis.

More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A
prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be
treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know
anything of the captain's colorful reputation.
