Nonplayer Characters
====================

This appendix contains statistics for various humanoid nonplayer
characters (NPCs) that adventurers might encounter during a campaign,
including lowly commoners and mighty archmages. These stat blocks can be
used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.

Customizing NPCs
----------------

There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your
home campaign.

**Racial Traits**: You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a
halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the Lucky trait. Adding
racial traits to an NPC doesn’t alter its challenge rating. **Armor and
Weapon Swaps**: You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s armor, or add or
switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an
NPC’s challenge rating. **Spell Swaps**: One way to customize an NPC
spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute
any spell on the NPC’s spell list with a different spell of the same
level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t
alter an NPC’s challenge rating. **Magic Items.** The more powerful an
NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession.
An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as
one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing
magic item could alter its challenge rating.

Archmages are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters dedicated to
the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel kings and queens,
while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom. Those who are
neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote towers to practice
their magic without interruption.

An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an
archmage’s abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to discourage
interlopers.

Assassin

Medium humanoid (any race), any non-good alignment

**Damage Resistances** poison

**Senses** passive Perception 13

**Languages** Thieves’ cant plus any two languages

**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP)

**Assassinate.** During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on
attack rolls against any creature that hasn’t taken a turn. Any hit the
assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.
**Evasion**: If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to
make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin
instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only
half damage if it fails. **Sneak Attack**: Once per turn, the assassin
deals an extra 14 (4d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon
attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is
within 5 feet of an ally of the assassin that isn’t incapacitated and
the assassin doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.

Actions

**Multiattack**: The assassin makes two shortsword attacks.
**Shortsword**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a
DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. **Light
Crossbow**: *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a
DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Trained in the use of poison, **assassins** are remorseless killers who
work for nobles, guildmasters, sovereigns, and anyone else who can
afford them.

Bandit
~~~~~~

Medium humanoid (any race), any non-lawful alignment

**Armor Class** 12 (leather armor)

**Hit Points** 11 (2d8 + 2)

Attack*: +3 to hit, range 80 ft./320 ft., one target. *Hit*: 5 (1d8 + 1)
piercing damage.

**Bandits** rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or
spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or
famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.

**Pirates** are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters
interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers
sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation’s vessels.

Bandit Captain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Medium humanoid (any race), any non-lawful alignment

**Armor Class** 15 (studded leather)

**Hit Points** 65 (10d8 + 20)

**Speed** 30 ft.

+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| STR          | DEX          | CON          | INT          | WIS          | CHA          |
+==============+==============+==============+==============+==============+==============+
| 15 (+2)      | 16 (+3)      | 14 (+2)      | 14 (+2)      | 11 (+0)      | 14 (+2)      |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+

**Saving Throws** Str +4, Dex +5, Wis +2

**Skills** Athletics +4, Deception +4

**Senses**: passive Perception 10

**Languages** any two languages

**Challenge** 2 (450 XP)

Actions

**Multiattack**: The captain makes three melee attacks: two with its
scimitar and one with its dagger. Or the captain makes two ranged
attacks with its daggers. **Scimitar**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.
**Dagger**: *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or
range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit*: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.

Reactions

**Parry**: The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that
would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be
wielding a melee weapon.

It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to
keep a gang of bandits in line. The **bandit captain** has these
qualities in spades.

In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the **pirate
captain** is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect
and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards
and punishment on a regular basis.

More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A
prisoner who appeals to the captain’s vanity or ego is more likely to be
treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know
anything of the captain’s colorful reputation.

Cultists swear allegiance to dark powers such as elemental princes,

acolytes, cultists often show signs of insanity in their beliefs and
practices.

in personal power above all else.

spirits, and provide spiritual guidance.

would hit it. To do so, the gladiator must see the attacker and be

Gladiators battle for the entertainment of raucous crowds. Some

life-or-death struggle, while others are professional duelists who
command huge fees but rarely fight to the death.

nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack
roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided
it can hear and understand the knight. A creature can benefit from only
one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the knight is
incapacitated.

Reactions

**Parry**: The knight adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that
would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding
a melee weapon.

Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and
noble causes. A knight’s alignment determines the extent to which a
pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a
knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and
hirelings who are commoners.

class, possessing wealth and connections that can make them as powerful
as monarchs and generals. A noble often travels in the company of

aren’t of noble birth.

Priests bring the teachings of their gods to the common folk. They are
the spiritual leaders of temples and shrines and often hold positions of
influence in their communities. Evil priests might work openly under a

A priest typically has one or more acolytes to help with religious
ceremonies and other sacred duties.
