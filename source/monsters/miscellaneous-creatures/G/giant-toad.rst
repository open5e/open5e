Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) poison damage, and the
target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target
is :ref:`srd:restrained`, and the toad can't bite another target.

**Swallow**: The
toad makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is
grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple
ends. The swallowed target is :ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`, it has total cover
against attacks and other effects outside the toad, and it takes 10
(3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the toad's turns. The toad can
have only one target swallowed at a time. If the toad dies, a swallowed
creature is no longer :ref:`srd:restrained` by it and can escape from the corpse
using 5 feet of movement, exiting :ref:`srd:prone`.
