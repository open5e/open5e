Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it
must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`.

**Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The wolf exhales a blast of freezing
wind in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12
Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) cold damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.

The arctic-dwelling **winter wolf** is as large as a dire wolf but has
snow-white fur and pale blue eyes. Frost giants use these evil creatures
as guards and hunting companions, putting the wolves' deadly breath
weapon to use against their foes. Winter wolves communicate with one
another using growls and barks, but they speak Common and Giant well
enough to follow simple conversations.
