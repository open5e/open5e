Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Tentacles**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 1 bludgeoning damage, and the target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape
DC 10). Until this grapple ends, the octopus can't use its tentacles on
another target.

Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). A 5- foot-radius cloud
of ink extends all around the octopus if it is underwater. The area is
heavily obscured for 1 minute, although a significant current can
disperse the ink. After releasing the ink, the octopus can use the Dash
action as a bonus action.
