Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit*: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11
Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage
reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but :ref:`srd:poisoned`
for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is :ref:`srd:paralyzed` while
:ref:`srd:poisoned` in this way.

A **phase spider** possesses the magical ability to phase in and out of
the Ethereal Plane. It seems to appear out of nowhere and quickly
vanishes after attacking. Its movement on the Ethereal Plane before
coming back to the Material Plane makes it seem like it can teleport.
