**Two-Headed**: The dog has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and
on saving throws against being :ref:`srd:blinded`, :ref:`srd:charmed`, :ref:`srd:deafened`, :ref:`srd:frightened`,
:ref:`srd:stunned`, or knocked :ref:`srd:unconscious`.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The dog makes two bite attacks.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon
Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing
damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12
Constitution saving throw against disease or become :ref:`srd:poisoned` until the
disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the creature must repeat
the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a
failure. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature
dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

A **death dog** is an ugly two-headed hound that roams plains, and
deserts. Hate burns in a death dog's heart, and a taste for humanoid
flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers. Death dog saliva
carries a foul disease that causes a victim's flesh to slowly rot off
the bone.
