attack roll against a creature if at least one of the lion's allies is
within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't :ref:`srd:incapacitated`.

**Pounce**: If the lion moves at least 20 feet straight toward a
creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that
target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked
:ref:`srd:prone`. If the target is :ref:`srd:prone`, the lion can make one bite attack against
it as a bonus action.
