The majestic **giant elk** is rare to the point that its appearance is
often taken as a foreshadowing of an important event, such as the birth
of a king. Legends tell of gods that take the form of giant elk when
visiting the Material Plane. Many cultures therefore believe that to
hunt these creatures is to invite divine wrath.
