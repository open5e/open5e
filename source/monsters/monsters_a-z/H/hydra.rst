**Hold Breath**: The hydra can hold its breath for 1 hour.

**Multiple
Heads**: The hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the
hydra has advantage on saving throws against being :ref:`srd:blinded`, :ref:`srd:charmed`,
:ref:`srd:deafened`, :ref:`srd:frightened`, :ref:`srd:stunned`, and knocked :ref:`srd:unconscious`. Whenever the
hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies.
If all its heads die, the hydra dies. At the end of its turn, it grows
two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it
has taken fire damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit
points for each head regrown in this way.

**Reactive Heads**: For each
head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be
used only for opportunity attacks.

**Wakeful**: While the hydra sleeps,
at least one of its heads is awake.
