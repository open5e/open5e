Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The harpy makes two attacks: one with its claws and one
with its club.

**Claws**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. *Hit*: 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage.

**Club**: *Melee Weapon
Attack*: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 3 (1d4 + 1)
bludgeoning damage.

**Luring Song**: The harpy sings a magical melody.
Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the
song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be :ref:`srd:charmed` until the
song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to
continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the
harpy is :ref:`srd:incapacitated`. While :ref:`srd:charmed` by the harpy, a target is
:ref:`srd:incapacitated` and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the :ref:`srd:charmed`
target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on
its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within
5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into
damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage
from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving
throw. A :ref:`srd:charmed` target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on
it. A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for
the next 24 hours.
