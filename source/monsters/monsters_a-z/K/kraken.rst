**Amphibious**: The kraken can breathe air and water.

**Freedom of
Movement**: The kraken ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects

of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being :ref:`srd:grappled`.

**Siege Monster**: The kraken deals double damage to objects and
structures.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The kraken makes three tentacle attacks, each of which
it can replace with one use of Fling.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*:
+17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 23 (3d8 + 10) piercing
damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature :ref:`srd:grappled` by the
kraken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While
swallowed, the creature is :ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`, it has total cover
against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and it takes 42
(12d6) acid damage at the start of each of the kraken's turns. If the
kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside
it, the kraken must succeed on a DC 25 Constitution saving throw at the
end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall
:ref:`srd:prone` in a space within 10 feet of the kraken. If the kraken dies, a
swallowed creature is no longer :ref:`srd:restrained` by it and can escape from the
corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting :ref:`srd:prone`.

**Tentacle**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +17 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit*: 20 (3d6 +
10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 18). Until
this grapple ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained`. The kraken has ten
tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

**Fling**: One Large or
smaller object held or creature :ref:`srd:grappled` by the kraken is thrown up to
60 feet in a random direction and knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. If a thrown target
strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for
every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another
creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw
or take the same damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`.

**Lightning Storm**: The
kraken magically creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can
strike a target the kraken can see within 120 feet of it. A target must
make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The kraken can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The kraken regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Tentacle Attack or Fling**: The kraken makes one tentacle attack or
uses its Fling.

**Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions)**: The kraken uses
Lightning Storm.

**Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions)**: While underwater, the
kraken expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around
corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than the
kraken. Each creature other than the kraken that ends its turn there
must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10)
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at
the end of the kraken's next turn.
