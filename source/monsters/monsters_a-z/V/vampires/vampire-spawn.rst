**Regeneration**: The vampire regains 10 hit points at the start of its

this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.

**Spider Climb**: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Vampire Weaknesses**: The vampire has the following flaws:

- **Forbiddance**: The vampire can't enter a residence without an
  invitation from one of the occupants.

- **Harmed by Running Water**: The vampire takes 20 acid damage when it
  ends its turn in running water.

- **Stake to the Heart**: The vampire is destroyed if a piercing weapon
  made of wood is driven into its heart while it is :ref:`srd:incapacitated` in its
  resting place.

- **Sunlight Hypersensitivity**: The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when
  it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage
  on attack rolls and ability checks.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The vampire makes two attacks, only one of which can be
a bite attack.

**Claws**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one creature. *Hit*: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. Instead of dealing
damage, the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 13).

**Bite**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing creature, or
a creature that is :ref:`srd:grappled` by the vampire, :ref:`srd:incapacitated`, or
:ref:`srd:restrained`. *Hit*: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic
damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to
the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to
that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.
The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
