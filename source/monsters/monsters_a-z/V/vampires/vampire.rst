**Shapechanger**: If the vampire isn't in sunlight or running water, it
can use its action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of
mist, or back into its true form. While in bat form, the vampire can't
speak, its walking speed is 5 feet, and it has a flying speed of 30
feet. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are unchanged.
Anything it is wearing transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying
does. It reverts to its true form if it dies. While in mist form, the
vampire can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. It is
weightless, has a flying speed of 20 feet, can hover, and can enter a
hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass
through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and it can't pass
through water. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution
saving throws, and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the
damage it takes from sunlight.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**: If the
vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Misty
Escape**: When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the
vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger trait)
instead of falling :ref:`srd:unconscious`, provided that it isn't in sunlight or
running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed. While it has 0
hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its vampire form, and it
must reach its resting place within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in its
resting place, it reverts to its vampire form. It is then :ref:`srd:paralyzed`
until it regains at least 1 hit point. After spending 1 hour in its
resting place with 0 hit points, it regains 1 hit point.

**Regeneration**: The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its
turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running
water. If the vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water,
this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.

**Spider Climb**: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including
upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Vampire Weaknesses**: The vampire has the following flaws:

- **Forbiddance**: The vampire can't enter a residence without an
  invitation from one of the occupants.

- **Harmed by Running Water**: The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it ends
  its turn in running water.

- **Stake to the Heart**: If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into
  the vampire's heart while the vampire is :ref:`srd:incapacitated` in its resting
  place, the vampire is :ref:`srd:paralyzed` until the stake is removed.

- **Sunlight Hypersensitivity**: The vampire takes 20 radiant damage when
  it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage
  on attack rolls and ability checks.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack (Vampire Form Only)**: The vampire makes two attacks, only
one of which can be a bite attack.

**Unarmed Strike (Vampire Form
Only)**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit*: 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Instead of dealing damage, the
vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 18).

**Bite (Bat or Vampire
Form Only)**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one willing
creature, or a creature that is :ref:`srd:grappled` by the vampire, :ref:`srd:incapacitated`,
or :ref:`srd:restrained`. *Hit*: 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic
damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to
the necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains hit points equal to
that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.
The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. A
humanoid slain in this way and then buried in the ground rises the
following night as a vampire spawn under the vampire's control.

**Charm**: The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 feet of
it. If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC
17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be :ref:`srd:charmed` by the vampire.
The :ref:`srd:charmed` target regards the vampire as a trusted friend to be heeded
and protected. Although the target isn't under the vampire's control, it
takes the vampire's requests or actions in the most favorable way it
can, and it is a willing target for the vampire's bite attack. Each time
the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything harmful to the
target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a
success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the vampire is
destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or
takes a bonus action to end the effect.

**Children of the Night
(1/Day)**: The vampire magically calls 2d4 swarms of bats or rats,
provided that the sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6
wolves instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as
allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain
for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire dismisses them
as a bonus action.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The vampire can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The vampire regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Move**: The vampire moves up to its speed without provoking
opportunity attacks.

**Unarmed Strike**: The vampire makes one unarmed
strike.

**Bite (Costs 2 Actions)**: The vampire makes one bite attack.
