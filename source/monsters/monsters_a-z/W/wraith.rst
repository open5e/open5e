Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Life Drain**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature. *Hit*: 21 (4d8 + 3) necrotic damage. The target must succeed
on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced
by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the
target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its
hit point maximum to 0.

**Create Specter**: The wraith targets a
humanoid within 10 feet of it that has been dead for no longer than 1
minute and died violently. The target's spirit rises as a specter in the
space of its corpse or in the nearest unoccupied space. The specter is
under the wraith's control. The wraith can have no more than seven
specters under its control at one time.
