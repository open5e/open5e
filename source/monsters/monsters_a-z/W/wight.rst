Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The wight makes two longsword attacks or two longbow
attacks. It can use its Life Drain in place of one longsword attack.

**Life Drain**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature. *Hit*: 5 (1d6 + 2) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on
a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by
an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the
target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its
hit point maximum to 0. A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours
later as a zombie under the wight's control, unless the humanoid is
restored to life or its body is destroyed. The wight can have no more
than twelve zombies under its control at one time.

**Longsword**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 6 (1d8 + 2)
slashing damage, or 7 (1d10 + 2) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Longbow**: *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage.
