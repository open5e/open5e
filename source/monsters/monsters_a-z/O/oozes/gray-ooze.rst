**Amorphous**: The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch
wide without squeezing.

**Corrode Metal**: Any nonmagical weapon made of
metal that hits the ooze corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon
takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its
penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made
of metal that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage. The ooze
can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1 round. 

**False
Appearance**: While the ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable
from an oily pool or wet rock.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Pseudopod**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 4 (1d6 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) acid damage,
and if the target is wearing nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly
corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it
offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.
