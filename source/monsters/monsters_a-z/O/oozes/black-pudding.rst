**Amorphous**: The pudding can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch
wide without squeezing.

**Corrosive Form**: A creature that touches the
pudding or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 4
(1d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits
the pudding corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent
and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5,
the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood
that hits the pudding is destroyed after dealing damage. The pudding can
eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical wood or metal in 1 round.

**Spider Climb**: The pudding can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down
on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Pseudopod**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage.
In addition, nonmagical armor worn by the target is partly dissolved and
takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The
armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Split**: When a pudding that is Medium or larger is subjected to
lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two new puddings if it has
at least 10 hit points. Each new pudding has hit points equal to half
the original pudding's, rounded down. New puddings are one size smaller
than the original pudding.
