**Amphibious**: The aboleth can breathe air and water.

**Mucous Cloud**: While underwater, the aboleth is surrounded by transformative mucus. A
creature that touches the aboleth or that hits it with a melee attack
while within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw.
On a failure, the creature is diseased for 1d4 hours. The diseased
creature can breathe only underwater.

**Probing Telepathy**: If a
creature communicates telepathically with the aboleth, the aboleth
learns the creature's greatest desires if the aboleth can see the
creature.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The aboleth makes three tentacle attacks.

**Tentacle**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 12
(2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must
succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. The
disease has no effect for 1 minute and can be removed by any magic that
cures disease. After 1 minute, the diseased creature's skin becomes
translucent and slimy, the creature can't regain hit points unless it is
underwater, and the disease can be removed only by heal or another
disease-curing spell of 6th level or higher. When the creature is
outside a body of water, it takes 6 (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes
unless moisture is applied to the skin before 10 minutes have passed.

**Tail**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft. one target. *Hit*: 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

**Enslave (3/Day)**: The aboleth
targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must
succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically :ref:`srd:charmed` by the
aboleth until the aboleth dies or until it is on a different plane of
existence from the target. The :ref:`srd:charmed` target is under the aboleth's
control and can't take reactions, and the aboleth and the target can
communicate telepathically with each other over any distance. Whenever
the :ref:`srd:charmed` target takes damage, the target can repeat the saving throw.
On a success, the effect ends. No more than once every 24 hours, the
target can also repeat the saving throw when it is at least 1 mile away
from the aboleth.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The aboleth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The aboleth regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect**: The aboleth makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Swipe**: The aboleth makes one tail attack.

**Psychic Drain (Costs 2 Actions)**: One creature :ref:`srd:charmed`
by the aboleth takes 10 (3d6) psychic
damage, and the aboleth regains hit points equal to the damage the
creature takes.
