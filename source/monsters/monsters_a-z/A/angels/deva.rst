Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The deva makes two melee attacks.

**Mace**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 7 (1d6 + 4)
bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) radiant damage.

**Healing Touch
(3/Day)**: The deva touches another creature. The target magically
regains 20 (4d8 + 2) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease,
poison, blindness, or deafness.

**Change Shape**: The deva magically
polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to
or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true
form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or
borne by the new form (the deva's choice). In a new form, the deva
retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement
modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of
the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class
features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but
that it lacks.
