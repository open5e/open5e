Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage. If the
target is a Large or smaller creature, it is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 13).
Until this grapple ends, the ankheg can bite only the :ref:`srd:grappled` creature
and has advantage on attack rolls to do so.

**Acid Spray (Recharge 6)**:
The ankheg spits acid in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide,
provided that it has no creature :ref:`srd:grappled`. Each creature in that line
must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) acid damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
