**Damage Transfer**: While attached to a creature, the cloaker takes
only half the damage dealt to it (rounded down), and that creature takes
the other half.

**False Appearance**: While the cloaker remains
motionless without its underside exposed, it is indistinguishable from a
dark leather cloak.

**Light Sensitivity**: While in bright light, the
cloaker has disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks
that rely on sight.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The cloaker makes two attacks: one with its bite and
one with its tail.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5
ft., one creature. *Hit*: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and if the
target is Large or smaller, the cloaker attaches to it. If the cloaker
has advantage against the target, the cloaker attaches to the target's
head, and the target is :ref:`srd:blinded` and unable to breathe while the cloaker
is attached. While attached, the cloaker can make this attack only
against the target and has advantage on the attack roll. The cloaker can
detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including
the target, can take its action to detach the cloaker by succeeding on a
DC 16 Strength check.

**Tail**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach
10 ft., one creature. *Hit*: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.

**Moan**: Each
creature within 60 feet of the cloaker that can hear its moan and that
isn't an aberration must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or
become :ref:`srd:frightened` until the end of the cloaker's next turn. If a
creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to the
cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours. Phantasms (Recharges after a Short
or Long Rest). The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates
of itself if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and
mimic its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to
track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an area
of bright light, the duplicates disappear. Whenever any creature targets
the cloaker with an attack or a harmful spell while a duplicate remains,
that creature rolls randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker
or one of the duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical
effect if it can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight. A
duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an attack
hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw against an
effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.
