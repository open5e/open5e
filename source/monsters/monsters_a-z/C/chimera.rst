Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The chimera makes three attacks: one with its bite, one
with its horns, and one with its claws. When its fire breath is
available, it can use the breath in place of its bite or horns.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage.

**Horns**: *Melee Weapon Attack*:
+7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 10 (1d12 + 4) bludgeoning
damage.

**Claws**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage.

**Fire Breath (Recharge
5-6)**: The dragon head exhales fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in
that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 31 (7d8) fire
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
