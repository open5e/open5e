Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The chuul makes two pincer attacks. If the chuul is
grappling a creature, the chuul can also use its tentacles once.

**Pincer**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. The target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape
DC 14) if it is a Large or smaller creature and the chuul doesn't have
two other creatures :ref:`srd:grappled`.

**Tentacles**: One creature :ref:`srd:grappled` by
the chuul must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be
:ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1 minute. Until this poison ends, the target is :ref:`srd:paralyzed`.
The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success.
