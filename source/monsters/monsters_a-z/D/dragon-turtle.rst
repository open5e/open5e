Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The dragon turtle makes three attacks: one with its
bite and two with its claws. It can make one tail attack in place of its
two claw attacks.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +13 to hit, reach 15
ft., one target. *Hit*: 26 (3d12 + 7) piercing damage.

**Claw**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 16 (2d8 +
7) slashing damage.

**Tail**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +13 to hit, reach
15 ft., one target. *Hit*: 26 (3d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the
target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw
or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the dragon turtle and knocked
:ref:`srd:prone`.

**Steam Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon turtle exhales
scalding steam in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a
DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being
underwater doesn't grant resistance against this damage.
