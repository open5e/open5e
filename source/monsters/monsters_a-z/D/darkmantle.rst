Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Crush**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit*: 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to
the target. If the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has
advantage on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target's
head, and the target is also :ref:`srd:blinded` and unable to breathe while the
darkmantle is attached in this way. While attached to the target, the
darkmantle can attack no other creature except the target but has
advantage on its attack rolls. The darkmantle's speed also becomes 0, it
can't benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target.
A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13
Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can detach
itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.

**Darkness Aura
(1/Day)**: A 15-foot radius of magical darkness extends out from the
darkmantle, moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness
lasts as long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10
minutes (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate
this darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the
darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level
or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.
