Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit*: 21
(2d10 + 10) piercing damage.

**Claw**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +17 to
hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 17 (2d6 + 10) slashing damage.

**Tail**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +17 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 19 (2d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence**: Each
creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon
and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become
:ref:`srd:frightened` for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a
creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24
hours.

**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon uses one of the
following breath weapons.

**Cold Breath**: The dragon exhales an icy
blast in a 90- foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24
Constitution saving throw, taking 67 (15d8) cold damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Paralyzing Breath**:
The dragon exhales paralyzing gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in
that area must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or be
:ref:`srd:paralyzed` for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Change Shape**: The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or
beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into
its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it
is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the
dragon's choice).

In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice,
ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its
statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new
form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect**: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack**: The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)**: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of
the dragon must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 17
(2d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon can then
fly up to half its flying speed.
