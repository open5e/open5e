Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit*: 19
(2d10 + 8) piercing damage.

**Claw**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +14 to hit,
reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.

**Tail**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit*: 17
(2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence**: Each creature of
the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of
it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for
1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is
immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon uses one of the following
breath weapons:

**Fire Breath**: The dragon exhales fire in an 90-foot
line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 21
Dexterity saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) fire damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Sleep Breath**: The dragon
exhales sleep gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must
succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or fall :ref:`srd:unconscious` for 10
minutes. This effect ends for a creature if the creature takes damage or
someone uses an action to wake it.

**Change Shape**: The dragon
magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge
rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to
its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is
absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice). In a new form,
the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to
speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and
Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its
statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new
form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect**: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack**: The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)**: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of
the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15
(2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon can then
fly up to half its flying speed.
