Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage.

**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)**:
The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

**Acid Breath**:
The dragon exhales acid in an 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each
creature in that line must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking
18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

**Slowing Breath**: The dragon exhales gas in a 15-foot
cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions, its
speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In
addition, the creature can use either an action or a bonus action on its
turn, but not both. These effects last for 1 minute. The creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself with a successful save.
