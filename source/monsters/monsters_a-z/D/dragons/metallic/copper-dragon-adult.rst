Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 17
(2d10 + 6) piercing damage.

**Claw**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +11 to hit,
reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.

**Tail**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit*: 15
(2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence**: Each creature of
the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of
it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for
1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is
immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon uses one of the following
breath weapons.

**Acid Breath**: The dragon exhales acid in an 60-foot
line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18
Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) acid damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Slowing Breath**: The
dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must
succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make
more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the creature can use
either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both. These
effects last for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a
successful save.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect**: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack**: The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)**: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of
the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13
(2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon can then
fly up to half its flying speed.
