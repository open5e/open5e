Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite and
two with its claws.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach
10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage.

**Claw**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 13
(2d6 + 6) slashing damage.

**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon
uses one of the following breath weapons.

**Cold Breath**: The dragon
exhales an icy blast in a 30- foot cone. Each creature in that area must
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) cold damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Paralyzing Breath**: The dragon exhales paralyzing gas in a 30-foot cone. Each
creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw
or be :ref:`srd:paralyzed` for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
