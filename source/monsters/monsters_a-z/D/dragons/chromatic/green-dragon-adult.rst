Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 17
(2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

**Claw**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 13 (2d6 + 6)
slashing damage.

**Tail**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +11 to hit, reach 15
ft., one target. *Hit*: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful
Presence**: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet
of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving
throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the
effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful
Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The
dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that
area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 56 (16d6)
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect**: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail
Attack**: The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2
Actions)**: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of
the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13
(2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon can then
fly up to half its flying speed.
