Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit*: 21
(2d10 + 10) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.

**Claw**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 17 (2d6 +
10) slashing damage.

**Tail**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +17 to hit, reach
20 ft., one target. *Hit*: 19 (2d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence**: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet
of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving
throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the
effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful
Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The
dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must
make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 91 (26d6) fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect**: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack**: The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)**: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of
the dragon must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 17
(2d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon can then
fly up to half its flying speed.
