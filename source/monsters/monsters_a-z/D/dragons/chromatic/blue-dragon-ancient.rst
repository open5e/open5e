Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit*: 20
(2d10 + 9) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) lightning damage.

**Claw**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 16
(2d6 + 9) slashing damage.

**Tail**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +16 to hit,
reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit*: 18 (2d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence**: Each creature of the dragon's choice that is
within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20
Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for 1 minute. A creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is
successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the
dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Lightning Breath
(Recharge 5-6)**: The dragon exhales lightning in a 120-foot line that is 10
feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 88 (16d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options
below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only
at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent
legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect**: The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail
Attack**: The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2
Actions)**: The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of
the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 16
(2d6 + 9) bludgeoning damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon can then
fly up to half its flying speed.
