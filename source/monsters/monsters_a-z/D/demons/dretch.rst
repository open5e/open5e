Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The dretch makes two attacks: one with its bite and one
with its claws.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. *Hit*: 3 (1d6) piercing damage.

**Claws**: *Melee Weapon
Attack*: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 5 (2d4) slashing
damage.

**Fetid Cloud (1/Day)**: A 10-foot radius of disgusting green
gas extends out from the dretch. The gas spreads around corners, and its
area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind
disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must
succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`srd:poisoned` until the
start of its next turn. While :ref:`srd:poisoned` in this way, the target can take
either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take
reactions.
