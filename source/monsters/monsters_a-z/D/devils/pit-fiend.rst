Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The pit fiend makes four attacks: one with its bite,
one with its claw, one with its mace, and one with its tail.

**Bite**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 22
(4d6 + 8) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21
Constitution saving throw or become :ref:`srd:poisoned`. While :ref:`srd:poisoned` in this
way, the target can't regain hit points, and it takes 21 (6d6) poison
damage at the start of each of its turns. The :ref:`srd:poisoned` target can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.

**Claw**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +14 to hit, reach
10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 17 (2d8 + 8) slashing damage.

**Mace**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 15
(2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (6d6) fire damage.

**Tail**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 24 (3d10 +
