tiger-humanoid hybrid or into a tiger, or back into its true form, which
is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each
form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It
reverts to its true form if it dies.

**Keen Hearing and Smell**: The
weretiger has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on
hearing or smell.

**Pounce (Tiger or Hybrid Form Only)**: If the
weretiger moves at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and then
hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on
a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. If the target is
:ref:`srd:prone`, the weretiger can make one bite attack against it as a bonus
action.
