Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The worm makes two attacks: one with its bite and one
with its stinger.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +9 to hit, reach 10
ft., one target. *Hit*: 22 (3d8 + 9) piercing damage. If the target is a
Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving
throw or be swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is :ref:`srd:blinded` and
:ref:`srd:restrained`, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside
the worm, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the
worm's turns. If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from
a creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution
saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed
creatures, which fall :ref:`srd:prone` in a space within 10 feet of the worm. If
the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer :ref:`srd:restrained` by it and
can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting :ref:`srd:prone`.


**Tail Stinger**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
creature. *Hit*: 19 (3d6 + 9) piercing damage, and the target must make
a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
