**Acid Absorption**: Whenever the golem is subjected to acid damage, it
takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the
acid damage dealt.

**Berserk**: Whenever the golem starts its turn with
60 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On
each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature
it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the
golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than
itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is
destroyed or regains all its hit points.

**Immutable Form**: The golem
is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

**Magic
Resistance**: The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells
and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons**: The golem's weapon attacks
are magical.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The golem makes two slam attacks.

**Slam**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 16 (2d10 + 5)
bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC
15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an
amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces
its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the
greater restoration spell or other magic.

**Haste (Recharge 5-6)**:
Until the end of its next turn, the golem magically gains a +2 bonus to
its AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and can use its slam
attack as a bonus action.
