Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The golem makes two slam attacks.

**Slam**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 19 (3d8 + 6)
bludgeoning damage.

**Slow (Recharge 5-6)**: The golem targets one or
more creatures it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a
DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target
can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than
one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an
action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1
minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
