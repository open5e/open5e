Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Withering Touch**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage.

**Etherealness**: The ghost
enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is
visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and
vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other
plane.

**Horrifying Visage**: Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of
the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or
be :ref:`srd:frightened` for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target
also ages 1d4 × 10 years. A :ref:`srd:frightened` target can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the :ref:`srd:frightened` condition
on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the
effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's Horrifying
Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be reversed with a
*greater restoration* spell, but only within 24 hours of it occurring.

**Possession (Recharge 6)**: One humanoid that the ghost can see within
5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be
possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is
:ref:`srd:incapacitated` and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the
body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be
targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn
undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma,
and immunity to being :ref:`srd:charmed` and :ref:`srd:frightened`. It otherwise uses the
possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's
knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.

The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost
ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an
effect like the :ref:`srd:dispel-evil-and-good` spell. When the possession ends,
the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the body.
The target is immune to this ghost's Possession for 24 hours after
succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.
