**Damage Immunities** lightning, thunder

**Senses** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 13

**Elemental Demise**: If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a
warm breeze, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or
carrying. **Innate Spellcasting**: The djinni’s innate spellcasting
ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It
can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material
components: **At will**: *detect evil and good*, *detect magic*,
*thunderwave* **3/day each**: *create food and water* (can create wine
instead of water), *tongues*, *wind walk* **1/day each**: *conjure
elemental* (air elemental only), *creation*, *gaseous form*,
*invisibility*, *major image*, *plane shift*

Actions

| **Multiattack**: The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.
  **Scimitar**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
  target. *Hit*: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or
  thunder damage (djinni’s choice). **Create Whirlwind**: A
  5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms
  on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind
  lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if
  concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the
  whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be
  restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as
  an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The
  whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.
|  A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the
  whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check.
  If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves
  to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.
