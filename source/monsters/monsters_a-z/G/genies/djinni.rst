carrying.

**Innate Spellcasting**: The djinni's innate spellcasting
ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It
can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material
components:

**At will**: :ref:`srd:detect-evil-and-good`, :ref:`srd:detect-magic`,
:ref:`srd:thunderwave`

**3/day each**: :ref:`srd:create-food-and-water` (can create wine
instead of water), :ref:`srd:tongues`, :ref:`srd:wind-walk`

**1/day each**: :ref:`srd:conjure-elemental` (air elemental only),
:ref:`srd:creation`, :ref:`srd:gaseous-form`,
:ref:`srd:invisibility`, :ref:`srd:major-image`, :ref:`srd:plane-shift`

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The djinni makes three scimitar attacks.

**Scimitar**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 12
(2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) lightning or thunder damage
(djinni's choice).

**Create Whirlwind**: A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall
cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see
within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni
maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature
but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18
Strength saving throw or be :ref:`srd:restrained` by it. The djinni can move the
whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures :ref:`srd:restrained` by the
whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of
it.

A creature can use its action to free a creature :ref:`srd:restrained` by the
whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18
Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer
:ref:`srd:restrained` and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.
