**Trampling Charge**: If the gorgon moves at least 20 feet straight
toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn,
that target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked
:ref:`srd:prone`. If the target is :ref:`srd:prone`, the gorgon can make one attack with its
hooves against it as a bonus action.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Gore**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 18 (2d12 + 5) piercing damage.

**Hooves**: *Melee Weapon Attack*:
+8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning
damage.

**Petrifying Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The gorgon exhales
petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target
begins to turn to stone and is :ref:`srd:restrained`. The :ref:`srd:restrained` target must
repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the
effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is :ref:`srd:petrified` until
freed by the *greater restoration* spell or other magic.
