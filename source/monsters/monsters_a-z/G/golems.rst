**Acid Absorption**: Whenever the golem is subjected to acid damage, it
takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the
acid damage dealt. **Berserk**: Whenever the golem starts its turn with
60 hit points or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On
each of its turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature
it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the
golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than
itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is
destroyed or regains all its hit points. **Immutable Form**: The golem
is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form. **Magic
Resistance**: The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells
and other magical effects. **Magic Weapons**: The golem’s weapon attacks
are magical.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

***Multiattack**: The golem makes two slam attacks. **Slam**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 16 (2d10 + 5)
bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC
15 Constitution saving throw or have its hit point maximum reduced by an
amount equal to the damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces
its hit point maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the
greater restoration spell or other magic. **Haste (Recharge 5–6)**:
Until the end of its next turn, the golem magically gains a +2 bonus to
its AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and can use its slam
attack as a bonus action.

  so until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.

  to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be able
  to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15 Charisma
  (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases being
  berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or fewer, the
  golem might go berserk again. **Aversion of Fire**: If the golem takes
  fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks
  until the end of its next turn. **Immutable Form**: The golem is
  immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form. **Lightning
  Absorption**: Whenever the golem is subjected to lightning damage, it
  takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to
  the lightning damage dealt. **Magic Resistance**: The golem has

***Multiattack**: The golem makes two slam attacks. **Slam**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 19 (3d8 + 6)
bludgeoning damage. **Slow (Recharge 5–6)**: The golem targets one or
more creatures it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a
DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target
can’t use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can’t make more than
one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an
action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1
minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
