Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one
attack with its rotting fist.

**Rotting Fist**: *Melee Weapon Attack*:
+9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning
damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it
must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with
mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point
maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the
curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and
its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove
curse spell or other magic.

**Dreadful Glare**: The mummy lord targets
one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the
mummy lord, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw against this
magic or become :ref:`srd:frightened` until the end of the mummy's next turn. If
the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also :ref:`srd:paralyzed` for
the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune
to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies and mummy lords for the next 24
hours.
