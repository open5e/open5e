**Magic Resistance**: The mummy lord has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects. **Rejuvenation**: A destroyed
mummy lord gains a new body in 24 hours if its heart is intact,
regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body
appears within 5 feet of the mummy lord’s heart. **Spellcasting**: The
mummy lord is a 10th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is
Wisdom (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The mummy lord
has the following cleric spells prepared: **Cantrips (at will)**:
*sacred flame*, *thaumaturgy* **1st level (4 slots)**: *command*,
*guiding bolt*, *shield of faith* **2nd level (3 slots)**: *hold
person*, *silence*, *spiritual weapon* **3rd level (3 slots)**: *animate

Actions

**Multiattack**: The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one
attack with its rotting fist. **Rotting Fist**: *Melee Weapon Attack*:
+9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning
damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it
must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with
mummy rot. The cursed target can’t regain hit points, and its hit point
maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the
curse reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and
its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove
curse spell or other magic. **Dreadful Glare**: The mummy lord targets
one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the
mummy lord, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw against this
magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy’s next turn. If
the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for
the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune
to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies and mummy lords for the next 24
hours.
