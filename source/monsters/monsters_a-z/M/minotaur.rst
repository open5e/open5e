**Charge**: If the minotaur moves at least 10 feet straight toward a
target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target
takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it
must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet
away and knocked :ref:`srd:prone`.

**Labyrinthine Recall**: The minotaur can
perfectly recall any path it has traveled.

**Reckless**: At the start of
its turn, the minotaur can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack
rolls it makes during that turn, but attack rolls against it have
advantage until the start of its next turn.
