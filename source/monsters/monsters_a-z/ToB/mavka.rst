Mavka
-----

*These twisted dryads have been turned into vampiric monstrosities
by undead warlocks and vampiric experiments.*

**Charred Dryads.** With burnt and blackened skin, burnt twigs
for hair, and clawed hands and feet that resemble burnt and
twisted roots, mavkas seem scorched and even frail. Pupil-less
red eyes gleam in their eye sockets with a hellish green flame.

**Death Riders.** All mavkas ride nightmare mounts as fearsome
raiders, often snatching victims up into the saddle, never to be
seen again. They despise and trample foot soldiers as peasants
unworthy of attention.

**Hag Killers.** Mavkas are the mortal enemies of red hags, who
call these undead horrors “greenbanes.”

**Undead Nature.** A mavka doesn’t require air, food, drink,
or sleep.
