Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The salamander makes two attacks: one with its spear
and one with its tail.

**Spear**: *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack*: +7 to
hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20 ft./60 ft., one target. *Hit*: 11 (2d6 + 4)
piercing damage, or 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands
to make a melee attack, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.

**Tail**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 11 (2d6 + 4)
bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage, and the target is :ref:`srd:grappled`
(escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained`, the
salamander can automatically hit the target with its tail, and the
salamander can't make tail attacks against other targets.
