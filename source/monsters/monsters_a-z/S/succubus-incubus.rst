**Telepathic Bond**: The fiend ignores the range restriction on its
telepathy when communicating with a creature it has :ref:`srd:charmed`. The two
don't even need to be on the same plane of existence.

**Shapechanger**:
The fiend can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium
humanoid, or back into its true form. Without wings, the fiend loses its
flying speed. Other than its size and speed, its statistics are the same
in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.
It reverts to its true form if it dies.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Claw (Fiend Form Only)**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. *Hit*: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**Charm**: One
humanoid the fiend can see within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15
Wisdom saving throw or be magically :ref:`srd:charmed` for 1 day. The :ref:`srd:charmed`
target obeys the fiend's verbal or telepathic commands. If the target
suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the
saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully
saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is
immune to this fiend's Charm for the next 24 hours. The fiend can have
only one target :ref:`srd:charmed` at a time. If it charms another, the effect on
the previous target ends.

**Draining Kiss**: The fiend kisses a creature
:ref:`srd:charmed` by it or a willing creature. The target must make a DC 15
Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 32 (5d10 + 5)
psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
one. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the
damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long
rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Etherealness**: The fiend magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the
Material Plane, or vice versa.
