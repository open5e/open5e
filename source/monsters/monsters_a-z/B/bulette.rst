Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 30 (4d12 + 4) piercing damage.

**Deadly Leap**: If the bulette
jumps at least 15 feet as part of its movement, it can then use this
action to land on its feet in a space that contains one or more other
creatures. Each of those creatures must succeed on a DC 16 Strength or
Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked :ref:`srd:prone` and take 14
(3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (3d6 + 4) slashing damage. On a
successful save, the creature takes only half the damage, isn't knocked
:ref:`srd:prone`, and is pushed 5 feet out of the bulette's space into an
unoccupied space of the creature's choice. If no unoccupied space is
within range, the creature instead falls :ref:`srd:prone` in the bulette's space.
