Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one
to constrict.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. *Hit*: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage.

**Constrict**: *Melee
Weapon Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature.
*Hit*: 17 (2d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (2d10 + 6) slashing
damage. The target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 16) if the behir isn't already
constricting a creature, and the target is :ref:`srd:restrained` until this grapple
ends.

**Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)**: The behir exhales a line of
lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that
line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10)
lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

**Swallow**: The behir makes one bite attack against a
Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target
is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is
:ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`, it has total cover against attacks and other
effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the
start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature
swallowed at a time. If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single
turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the
creature, which falls :ref:`srd:prone` in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If
the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer :ref:`srd:restrained` by it and
can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting :ref:`srd:prone`.
