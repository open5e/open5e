one with its claws.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5
ft., one creature. *Hit*: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8)
poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving

throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success.

**Claws**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 7 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.

**Web (Recharge 5-6)**:
*Ranged Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one Large or smaller
creature. *Hit*: The creature is :ref:`srd:restrained` by webbing. As an action,
the :ref:`srd:restrained` creature can make a DC 11 Strength check, escaping from
the webbing on a success. The effect also ends if the webbing is
destroyed. The webbing has AC 10, 5 hit points, vulnerability to fire
damage, and immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage.
