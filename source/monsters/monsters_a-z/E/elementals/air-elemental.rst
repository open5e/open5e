Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The elemental makes two slam attacks.

**Slam**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 14 (2d8 + 5)
bludgeoning damage.

**Whirlwind (Recharge 4-6)**: Each creature in the
elemental's space must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failure,
a target takes 15 (3d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet
away from the elemental in a random direction and knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. If a
thrown target strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target
takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the
target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC
13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`.

If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the
bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked :ref:`srd:prone`.
