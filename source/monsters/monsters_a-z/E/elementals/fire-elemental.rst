**Fire Form**: The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1
inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the elemental or
hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5 (1d10)
fire damage. In addition, the elemental can enter a hostile creature's
space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a
turn, that creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage and catches fire; until
someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 5 (1d10)
fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Illumination**: The
elemental sheds bright light in a 30- foot radius and dim light in an
additional 30 feet.

**Water Susceptibility**: For every 5 feet the
elemental moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it,
it takes 1 cold damage.

**Touch**:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 10
(2d6 + 3) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable
object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire,
the target takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
