**Legendary Resistance (3/Day)**: If the tarrasque fails a saving throw,
it can choose to succeed instead.

**Magic Resistance**: The tarrasque
has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.


**Reflective Carapace**: Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a :ref:`srd:magic-missile` spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack
roll, roll a d6. On a 1 to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the
tarrasque is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster
as though it originated from the tarrasque, turning the caster into the
target.

**Siege Monster**: The tarrasque deals double damage to objects
and structures.

Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Multiattack**: The tarrasque can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its
horns, and one with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its
bite.

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 36 (4d12 + 10) piercing damage. If the target is a
creature, it is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the
target is :ref:`srd:restrained`, and the tarrasque can't bite another target.

**Claw**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +19 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit*: 28 (4d8 + 10) slashing damage.

**Horns**: *Melee Weapon Attack*:
+19 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 32 (4d10 + 10) piercing
damage.

**Tail**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +19 to hit, reach 20 ft., one
target. *Hit*: 24 (4d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a
creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked
:ref:`srd:prone`.

**Frightful Presence**: Each creature of the tarrasque's choice
within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for 1 minute. A creature can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if
the tarrasque is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a
success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends
for it, the creature is immune to the tarrasque's Frightful Presence for
the next 24 hours.

**Swallow**: The tarrasque makes one bite attack
against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits,
the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the
grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is :ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`,
it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the
tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each of
the tarrasque's turns. If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a
single turn from a creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a
DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate
all swallowed creatures, which fall :ref:`srd:prone` in a space within 10 feet of
the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature is no longer
:ref:`srd:restrained` by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of
movement, exiting :ref:`srd:prone`.

Legendary Actions
