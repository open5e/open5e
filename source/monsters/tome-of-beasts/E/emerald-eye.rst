Emerald Eye
-----------

*Witches and ioun mages know how to craft a speaking crystal. Its
primary use is as a debating companion and ally—but many turn
to treachery and hatred. These are the emerald eyes.*

**Servants of Logic.** A mystic or psion will debate logic with a
speaking crystal based on his rational mind, or discuss morality
with a speaking crystal based on his conscience. Chaotic psions
create speaking crystals based on their primal urges, and such
crystals sometimes abandon or even kill their creators. Once
free, they revel in the world’s pleasures.

**Trapped Manipulators.** Most speaking crystals are pink or
purple when created, but those that betray their creators turn
a dark shade of green. These floating oval-shaped crystals are
physically weak, but they retain considerable magical powers
to manipulate those around them. This becomes critically
important when the emerald eye discovers that killing its creator
frees it from the creator’s control but doesn’t free it from the
need to remain within 25 feet of some creature it is bound to.
This is often the dead body of its creator if no other creature is
available.

**Shifting Goals.** An emerald eye’s motivations change
over time. One may be purposeful, using its powers to drive
its bound creature toward some specific goal. Another might
feign cooperativeness, offering to share its defensive abilities
in exchange for the creature’s mobility. Still another might be a
manipulative trickster, pretending to be an ioun stone, floating in
circles around an ally’s or victim’s head while sparkling brightly
to inspire jealousy and theft among its viewers.

Smaller than a clenched fist, an emerald eye weighs at most half
a pound.

**Constructed Nature.** An emerald eye doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

**Bound.** An emerald eye cannot move more than 25 feet away
from the creature that it is psychically linked to. It begins
existence bound to its creator, but a free emerald eye can bind
itself to another creature as in the Bind action.

**Immutable Form.** The emerald eye is immune to any spell or
effect that would alter its form.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Slash.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 14 (5d4 + 2) slashing damage.

**Attraction (Recharge 5-6).** An emerald eye can compel one
creature to move toward a particular person or object. If
the creature fails a DC 13 Charisma saving throw, it feels a
powerful compulsion to move toward whatever the emerald
eye chooses. The target creature must be within 25 feet of the
emerald eye when attraction is triggered, but the creature is
then free to move beyond this range while remaining under
the effect. Nothing seems out of the ordinary to the creature,
but it does not knowingly put itself or its allies in harm’s way
to reach the object. The creature may attempt another DC
13 Charisma saving throw at the start of each of its turns; a
success ends the effect.

**Bind (3/Day).** The emerald eye can bind itself psychically to a
creature with an Intelligence of 6 or greater. The attempt fails
if the target succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. The
attempt is unnoticed by the target, regardless of the result.

**Telepathic Lash (3/Day).** An emerald eye can overwhelm one
humanoid creature within 25 feet with emotions and impulses
the creature is hard-pressed to control. If the target fails a DC
13 Wisdom saving throw, it is :ref:`srd:stunned` for 1 round.
