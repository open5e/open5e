Empty Cloak
-----------

*Dark cloth of black and purple, stitched with silver and golden
threads, this resembles a garment of elvish make. Smoke sometimes
billows under the hood.*

**Silent Motion.** A billowing empty cloak glides through the
air, either under its own power or on the shoulders of its master.
Its movement appears odd somehow, as though it moves slightly
out of step with the frame bearing it.

**Guards.** Created by the shadow fey as unobtrusive guardians,
empty cloaks are often paired with animated armor such as a
:ref:`tob:monolith-footman`, and made to look like a display piece.

**Shadow Servants.** Shadow fey nobles sometimes wear an
empty cloak as their own clothing; they use it to cover a hasty
retreat or to assist in a kidnapping.

**Constructed Nature.** An empty cloak doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.
