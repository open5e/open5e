Duelist (Shadow Fey)
--------------------

The pale-skinned elf wears a gleaming breastplate and tight-fitting
clothing. He moves like the wind, evading blows with effortless
skill. When he stops and smiles, his blade is slick with crimson.
Shadow fey duelists are elite warriors, often of noble lineage.
Swift and sure beyond compare, duelists are often taller and
more wiry than others of their kind. Their armor, clothing, and
weapons are of exquisite make, fashioned from only the finest
materials, as befits their station.

A nobleman or woman of the shadow fey is not to be taken
lightly—many courtiers or politicians are deadly with their slim
blades, and they are known to distill virulent poisons. Often a
skilled duelist serves as a champion for her liege, standing in the
noble’s stead in challenges or serving as an elite bodyguard.
