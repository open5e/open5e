Flutterflesh
------------

*This mass of fused corpses resembles a butterfly with wings of skin,
limbs of bone, and a head formed of several different skulls. The dark
magic that formed this abomination swirls around it hungrily.*

**Bound by Necromancy.** Flutterflesh result from a terrible
necromantic ritual. Cultists gather in the name of a dark god,
powerful lich, or crazed
madman, and forever
bind themselves body and
soul into a single evil being.
Flutterflesh take recently
severed limbs and fuse these new
pieces to themselves in accordance
with some unknowable aesthetic.

**Dilemma of Flesh.** The most
horrifying thing about a flutterflesh,
however, is its devious nature. A
flutterflesh offers its prey the choice to either
die or lose a limb. One can always tell where a
flutterflesh resides because so many of the locals
are missing appendages.

**Undead Nature.** A flutterflesh doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

**Magic Weapons.** The flutterflesh’s attacks are magical.

**Turn Resistance.** The flutterflesh has advantage on saving
throws against any effect that turns undead.

**Creeping Death.** A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet
of the flutterflesh must make a successful DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or take 14 (4d6) necrotic damage.

**Regeneration.** The flutterflesh regains 10 hit points at the start of
its turn. If the flutterflesh takes radiant or fire damage, this trait
doesn’t function at the start of its next turn. The flutterflesh dies
only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The flutterflesh makes two bone spur attacks or
two tormenting gaze attacks.

**Bone Spur.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 17 (2d12 + 4) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10)
necrotic damage. If both attacks hit a single creature in the
same turn, it is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 10). As a bonus action, the
flutterflesh can choose whether this attack does bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing damage.

**Tormenting Gaze.** A target creature within 120 feet and able
to see the flutterflesh takes 18 (4d8) psychic damage and
is :ref:`srd:paralyzed` for 1d4 rounds, or takes half damage and isn’t
paralyzed with a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.
Tormenting gaze can’t be used against the same target twice
in a single turn.

**Slash.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. On a critical hit, the target
takes an additional 27 (5d10) slashing damage and must make
a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the flutterflesh
lops off and absorbs one of the target’s limbs (chosen
randomly) and heals hit points equal to the additional slashing
damage it inflicted.
