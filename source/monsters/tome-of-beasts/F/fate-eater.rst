Fate Eater
----------

*These human-sized parasites resemble ghostly centipedes
surrounded in erratic violet radiance. Their flesh is translucent
and their jaws are crystalline—they are clearly creatures of strange
planes indeed.*

**Destiny Destroyers.** Fate eaters infest remote areas of
the planes, where they consume the threads of Fate itself. The
Norns view them as vermin and sometimes engage particularly
canny planar travelers either to hunt them or to help repair the
damage they have done. This can be a deadly job as the fate eaters
consider the destiny of a mortal to be the tastiest of delicacies,
rich in savory possibilities.

**Planar Gossips.** Fate eaters can and do trade information
about various dooms, fates, and outcomes, but one must have
something rich in destiny to trade—or at least, juicy gossip about
gods and demons.

**Visionary Flesh.** Eating the properly-prepared flesh of a fate
eater grants insight into the fate of another.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The fate eater’s innate
spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC
15). It can innately cast the following spells,
requiring no material components:

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:blink`, :ref:`srd:hallucinatory-terrain`

**Visionary Flesh.** Eating the flesh
of a fate eater requires a DC 15
Constitution saving throw. If
successful, the eater gains a
:ref:`srd:divination` spell. If failed, the
victim vomits blood and fails
the next saving throw made
in combat.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
26 (5d8 + 4) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) necrotic damage.

**Spectral Bite.** When a fate eater scores a critical hit against a
target, it damages not only the creature but also the threads
of its fate, changing the character’s past or future. The target
must roll 1d6 on the chart below for each critical hit that isn’t
negated by a successful DC 15 Charisma saving throw:

= ===================== ========================================================================================================================================================
1 Seeing the Alternates Suffers the effects of the :ref:`srd:confusion` spell for 1d4 rounds
2 Untied from the Loom  Character’s speed is randomized for four rounds. Roll 3d20 at the start of each of the character’s turns to determine his or her speed in feet that turn
3 Shifting Memories     Permanently loses proficiency in a random proficient skill and gains proficiency in random unproficient skill
4 Not So Fast           Loses the use of one class ability, chosen at random
5 Lost Potential        Loses 1 point from one randomly chosen ability score
6 Took the Lesser Path  The character’s current hit point total becomes his or her hit point maximum
= ===================== ========================================================================================================================================================

Effects 3-6 are permanent until the character makes a
successful Charisma saving throw. The saving throw is
repeated after every long rest, but the DC increases by 1
after every long rest, as the character becomes more
entrenched in this new destiny. Otherwise, these
new fates can be undone by nothing short of a
:ref:`srd:wish` spell or comparable magic.
