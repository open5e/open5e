Weeping Treant
--------------

*This twisted tree’s face is made of cracked, black bark
knotted into vaguely humanoid features, and thick
tears of sap run down its face.*

Weeping treants clearly are related to other
treants, but they are smaller than the normal
variety, little more than 30 feet tall with a trunk 3 feet
in diameter, and weighing no more than 4,500 lb. Their
gnarled trunks are often twisted, and their wood often groans
when they move.

**Forest Wardens.** Weeping treants are protectors of
dark, shadowy forests, and they are as long-lived as the trees
themselves. They act as guardians for an entire forest or for
something specific within the forest—they have no pity for those
carrying axes or fire.

**Skeptical Mein.** Weeping treants are terrifying and relentless
when fighting in defense of their charge. They are inherently
distrustful, particularly of anything not of the natural or shadow
world, and they’re notoriously difficult to fool or deceive.

**Enchanted Bitter Tears.** Sages and scholars debate why
these creatures weep, but no one has come forward with
a compelling reason beyond “it’s what trees do.” The
weeping treants themselves refuse to speak on the
matter. Their tears are occasionally components
in druidic spells or items.

**Siege Monster.** The treant deals double damage to objects and

**Treespeech.** A weeping treant can converse with plants, and
most plants greet them with a friendly or helpful attitude.

**Acidic Tears.** Thick tears of dark sap stream continuously down
the treant’s face and trunk. These tears are highly acidic—
anyone who attacks the treant from a range of 5 feet or less
must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 6
(1d12) acid damage from splashed tears. This acidic matter
continues doing 6 (1d12) acid damage at the start of each of
the creature’s turns until it or an adjacent ally uses an action to
wipe off the tears or three rounds elapse.
