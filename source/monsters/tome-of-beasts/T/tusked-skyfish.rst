Tusked Skyfish
--------------

*This horrid creature looks like an enormous flying jellyfish,
with long, wicked tusks curving from its gaping mouth and
tentacle-whiskers trailing behind it.*

**Alchemical Flotation.** These aerial jellyfish waft
through the air like balloons, suspended by internal
alchemical reactions. This mode of movement takes
them almost vertically when they wish, or drifts with the
winds. They can reach altitudes of 30,000 feet.

**Shocking Tendrils.** Tusked skyfish catch slow-moving
or inattentive prey in their tentacles, and sometimes fish in
shallow lakes and streams. They can suppress their natural
electrical charge, allowing them to manipulate objects or
interact with other creatures safely.

**Slow Mounts.** When fitted with special saddles, tusked skyfish
can be ridden without harming their riders, although their
slow speed makes them most suitable for casual excursions or
unhurried long-distance travel. The jinnborn and genies seem to
find them congenial beasts of burden, carrying as much as 4,000
pounds.

**Tendril Curtain.** When the tusked skyfish is flying, its wispy,
electrified tendrils dangle beneath it and touch all creatures
within 20 feet directly below its space as it moves. Any
creatures in the path of its movement take 10 (3d6) lightning
damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dexterity
saving throw.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The tusked skyfish makes one gore attack and one
tentacles attack.

**Gore.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage.

**Tentacles.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
creature. *Hit:* 13 (3d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6)
lightning damage. The target is also :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC
13). Until this grapple ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained`. While
grappling the target, the tusked skyfish can’t use this attack
against other targets. When the tusked skyfish moves, a
Medium or smaller target it is grappling moves with it.

**Stench Spray (Recharge 5–6).** The tusked skyfish sprays
foul‑smelling liquid in a line 20 feet long and 5 feet wide.
Each creature in that line must make a successful DC 13
Constitution saving throw or become :ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1 minute.
If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature falls
unconscious for the same duration. A poisoned creature
repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success.
