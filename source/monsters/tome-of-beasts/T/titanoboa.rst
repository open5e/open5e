Titanoboa
---------

*A This titanic green serpent can raise its enormous head high
above, as much as 20 feet high. Its body extends in seemingly
endless coils.*

**Territorial and Aggressive.** Territorial and voracious, the
rare titanoboa devours all trespassers in its domain. Stronger and
faster than the giant anaconda, the true king of the rainforest is
also more stubborn, fighting off entire groups of hunters and
poachers. When stalking prey, these great serpents strike from
ambush, swallowing even many dinosaurs in one bite.

**Blinding Scales.** Against groups of foes, titanoboas trust in
their ability to dazzle their enemies with the light reflected from
their scales, using this distraction to entwine the stunned foes in
crushing coils.

**Slow to Mate.** Titanoboas mate rarely. They live for hundreds
of years and never stop growing, which makes the need for
propagation less urgent. When two titanoboas nest, the result
is a brood of a half-dozen smaller snakes (:ref:`giant constrictor snakes <srd:giant-constrictor-snake>`).
An adult titanoboa is at least 80 feet long and weighs
6,000 lb. or more.

**Slither.** If the titanoboa hasn’t eaten a Huge creature
in the last 24 hours, it can move through a space as
narrow as 10 feet wide without squeezing, or 5 feet
while squeezing.

**Sparkling Scales.** The titanoboa’s scales refract light in
iridescent cascades that are hypnotic to gaze upon. If the
titanoboa is in bright light, a creature within 30 feet
that looks at it must make a successful DC 17
Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the
end of its next turn. Unless surprised, a
creature can avoid the saving throw by
choosing to avert its eyes at the start
of its turn. A creature that averts its
eyes can’t see the titanoboa until
the start of its next turn, when
it can choose to avert its eyes
again. If the creature looks at the
titanoboa in the meantime, it must
immediately make the saving throw.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The titanoboa makes one bite attack and one
constrict attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 21 (3d8 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a Huge or
smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving
throw or be swallowed by the titanoboa. A swallowed creature
is :ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`, has total cover against attacks
and other effects outside the snake, and takes 21 (6d6) acid
damage at the start of each of the titanoboa’s turns. If the
titanoboa takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from
a creature inside it, the titanoboa must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate
all swallowed creatures, which fall :ref:`srd:prone` in a space within
10 feet of the titanoboa. If the titanoboa dies, a swallowed
creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the
corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting :ref:`srd:prone`.

**Constrict.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 15 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 27 (3d12 + 8)
bludgeoning damage, and the
target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC
18). Until this grapple ends,
the target is :ref:`srd:restrained`,
and the titanoboa can’t
constrict another target.
