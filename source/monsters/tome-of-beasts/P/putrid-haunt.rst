Putrid Haunt
------------

*These shambling corpses have twigs, branches, and other debris
intertwined with their bodies, and their gaping maws often crawl
with scrabbling vermin.*

**Swamp Undead.** Putrid haunts are walking corpses infused
with moss, mud, and the detritus of the deep swamp. They
are the shambling remains of individuals who, either through
mishap or misdeed, died while lost in a vast swampland. Their
desperate need to escape the marshland in life transforms into
a hatred of all living beings in death. They often gather in places
tainted by evil deeds.

**Mossy Islands.** When no potential victims are nearby, putrid
haunts sink into the water and muck, where moss and water
plants grow over them and vermin inhabit their rotting flesh.
When living creatures draw near, the dormant putrid haunt
bursts from its watery hiding spot and attacks its prey, slamming
wildly with its arms and stomping on prone foes to push them
deeper into the muck. There’s no planning and little cunning in
their assault, but they move through the marshes more freely
than most intruders and they attack with a single-mindedness
that’s easily mistaken for purpose.

**Leech Harbors.** Putrid haunts create especially
favorable conditions for leeches. They are often hosts or
hiding places for large gatherings of leeches.

**Undead Nature.** A putrid haunt doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

**Vomit Leeches (Recharge 6).** A putrid haunt can vomit forth the
contents of its stomach onto a target within 5 feet. Along with
the bile and mud from its stomach, this includes 2d6 undead
leeches that attach to the target. A creature takes 1 necrotic
damage per leech on it at the start of the creature’s turn, and
the putrid haunt gains the same number of temporary hit
points. As an action, a creature can remove or destroy 1d3
leeches from itself or an adjacent ally.
