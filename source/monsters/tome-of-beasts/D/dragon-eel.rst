Dragon Eel
----------

*The dragon eel’s unmistakable slender form sports a
powerful single finned tail and wicked jaws like
a matched pair of serrated blades. Dragon eels
vary widely in color from browns and blacks to
brilliant iridescent hues in mottled patterns.*

**Fond of Servants.** While most dragon
eels are solitary and irascible, on rare instances
some form pairs or small bands—and some gather
humanoid servants.

**Magnetic and Lightning.** Dragon eels make
their natural homes in twisting underwater
cave systems and prefer magnetically-aligned,
metallic cavern formations navigable with
their refined electric-sight. Some dragon
eels use their constant electric auras
combined with acquired alchemical
reagents to electroplate portions of
their golden hoard onto the walls
of their dwellings.

**Pirate Fleets and
Dominions.** Dragon
eels claim large swaths
of shoreline as their
demesne. Although
neither particularly cruel
nor righteous, a dragon eel
often lords over awed tribes, allowing locals to revere it as a
mighty spirit. Some dragon eels use such tribes as the core of a
pirate fleet or raiding parties carried on their backs. Their ability
to swim through air during storms adds to their reputation as
terrible thunder spirits.

**Bribable.** Their deceptive moniker sometimes lulls foolish
sailors into a false confidence when they expect to face a simple
if dangerous eel beast, but instead find themselves dealing with
intelligent draconic kings of the coastal shallows. Wise sailors
traveling through known dragon eel territory bring tithes and
offerings to placate them.

**Limited Amphibiousness.** The dragon eel can breathe air and
water, but it needs to be submerged at least once every six
hours to avoid suffocation.

**Shocking Touch.** A dragon eel’s body generates a potent
charge of lightning. A creature that touches or makes a
successful melee attack against a dragon eel takes 5 (1d10)
lightning damage.

**Storm Glide.** During storms, the dragon eel can travel through
the air as if under the effects of a fly spell, except using its
swim speed.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dragon eel makes one bite attack and one tail
slap attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 26 (4d8 + 8) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) lightning

saving throw or become :ref:`srd:paralyzed` for 1d4 rounds.

**Tail Slap.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 30 (5d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (1d10)
lightning damage and push the target up to 10 feet away.

**Lightning Breath (Recharge 6).** The dragon eel exhales
lightning in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each target in
that line takes 55 (10d10) lightning damage, or half damage
with a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw.
