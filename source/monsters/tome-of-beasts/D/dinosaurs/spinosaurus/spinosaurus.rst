**Tamed.** The spinosaurus will never willingly attack any reptilian
humanoid, and if forced or magically compelled to do so, it
suffers disadvantage on attack rolls. Up to twelve Medium
or four Large creatures can ride the spinosaurus. This trait
disappears if the spinosaurus spends a month away from any
reptilian humanoid.

**Siege Monster.** The spinosaurus deals double damage to
objects and structures.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The spinosaurus makes one bite attack and two
claw attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 34 (4d12 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a Large
or smaller creature, it is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 18). When the
spinosaurus moves, the grappled creature moves with it. Until
this grapple ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained` and the spinosaurus
can’t bite another target.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 22 (4d6 + 8) slashing damage.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the spinosaurus’ choice
that is within 120 feet of the spinosaurus and aware of it
must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become
:ref:`srd:frightened` for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful
or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the
spinosaurus’ Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
