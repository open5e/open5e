Coral Drake
-----------

*Swimming upright, this creature peels itself from the vibrant
seascape and strikes with needle-thin claws, shredding teeth, and a
wickedly curved stinger.*

**Camouflaged Hunter.** Like a piece of moving coral, this
drake’s coloration and scale patterns change to match nearby
anemones, corals, seaweed, and sea urchins. This adaptation
allows the creature considerable stealth in its natural habitat. It
avoids combat if it can, preferring to hide and protect its young.
Long serrated spines stretch from the coral drake’s body, waving
in brilliant colors against a blue sea.

**All Spikes and Needles.** The creature’s long snout stretches
out from its narrow face and an array of spikes and slender
protrusions form a jagged crown. Inside the mouth, serrated
teeth form multiple ringed ridges where it’s young feed on
leftover scraps of food and small parasites. Needle-thin talons
spring from finned appendages, and a stinger frilled with tiny
barbs curves at the end of its slender tail.

A coral drake measures seven feet from the tip of its snout to
its barbed stinging tail. Thin and agile, the beast weighs less than
100 lb. Both male and female coral drakes gestate their delicate
eggs inside sacks within their mouths and throats. This oral
incubation protects the vulnerable eggs, but only a handful ever
reach maturity, because their parents use the ravenous spawn
for defense.

**Poisonous Lairs.** Coral drakes live in warm waters near
great coral reefs. They hollow out small lairs and protect their
meager hoards with the aid of the area’s natural inhabitants.
Because they are immune to poison, coral drakes often choose
lairs nestled in forests of poisonous sea urchins, stinging
anemones, and toxic corals.

Aside from humankind, the coral drake harbors a great
rivalry with the :ref:`dragon turtles <srd:dragon-turtle>`. These beasts prize the same hunting
grounds and nests and fight for supremacy in the richest reefs.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The coral drake makes one bite attack, one claw
attack, and one stinger attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 22 (4d8 +4) slashing damage.

**Stinger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage, and the target must
succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6)
poison damage at the start of each of its turns for 4 rounds.
The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Breath Weapon (Recharge 5-6).** Coral drakes nurture their
offspring in specialized throat sacs. They can pressurize these
sacs to spew forth a 15-foot cone of spawn. Each target in
this area takes 21 (6d6) piercing damage from thousands
of tiny bites and is :ref:`srd:blinded` for 1d4 rounds; a successful DC
15 Dexterity saving throw reduces the damage by half and
negates the blindness.
