Derro Fetal Savant
------------------

*This creature resembles a blue-skinned dwarven infant, no older
than a year. Its limbs flail and its head lolls with an obvious lack of
coordination, and it screams incessantly.*

Of the madness and insanity that resonates so strongly in derro
society, perhaps none is so twisted as these premature infants,
born insane and destined to lead their people further into
madness. These derro are known as fetal savants.

**Soul Swapping.** Only the rarest of derro are born with the ability
to exchange souls with other creatures, and when discovered, the
babbling infants are treated with maddened reverence.

**Carried into Battle.** Placed in small, intricately wrought
pillowed cages and borne aloft on hooked golden staves, the
wild-eyed newborns are used to sow madness and confusion
among enemy ranks.

**Fear the Sun.** Fetal savants hate and fear all bright lights.

**Enchanted Cage.** The iron cage that holds the fetal savant
provides cover for the creature. The cage (AC 19, 10 hp) is
considered an equipped object when borne by a derro and
cannot be attacked directly. In addition, the cage protects the
occupant from up to 20 spell levels of spells 4th level or lower
but provides no protection to those outside of the cage. Spells
of level 5 or higher take full, normal effect against the cage
and its occupant. Once the cage protects against 20 or more
spell levels it is rendered non-magical. If exposed to direct
sunlight for over one hour of cumulative time it is destroyed.

**Madness.** A derro fetal savant’s particular madness grants it
immunity to psychic effects. It cannot be restored to sanity by
any means short of a :ref:`srd:wish` spell or comparable magic. A derro
fetal savant brought to sanity gains 4 points of Wisdom and
loses 6 points of Charisma.

**Vulnerability to Sunlight.** A derro fetal savant takes 1 point of
Constitution damage for every hour it is exposed to sunlight,
and it dies if its Constitution score reaches 0. Lost Constitution
points are recovered at the rate of 1/day spent underground or
otherwise sheltered from the sun.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Babble.** The sight of potential host bodies so excites the
fetal savant that it babbles and giggles madly and childishly,
creating an insanity effect. All sane creatures that start their
turns within 60 feet of the fetal savant must succeed on a DC
13 Charisma saving throw or be affected by confusion (as the
spell) for 1d4 rounds. This is a psychic effect. Creatures that
successfully save cannot be affected by the same fetal savant’s
babbling for 24 hours. This action cannot be taken when the
fetal savant is using Soul Exchange.

**Soul Exchange.** As an action, the fetal savant can attempt to
take control of a creature it can see within 90 feet, forcing an
exchange of souls as a magic jar spell, using its own body as
the container. The fetal savant can use this power at will, but
it can exchange souls with only one other creature at a time.
The victim resists the attack with a successful DC 13 Charisma
saving throw. A creature that successfully saves is immune
to the same fetal savant’s soul exchange for 24 hours. If the
saving throw fails, the fetal savant takes control of the target’s
body and ferociously attacks nearby opponents, eyes blazing
with otherworldly light.

As an action, the fetal savant can shift from its host body
back to its own, if it is within range, returning the victim’s soul
to its own body. If the host body or fetal savant is brought to 0
hit points within 90 feet of each other, the two souls return to
their original bodies and the creature at 0 hit points is dying;
it must make death saving throws until it dies, stabilizes, or
regains hit points, as usual. If the host body or fetal savant is
slain while they are more than 90 feet apart, their souls cannot
return to their bodies and they are both slain. While trapped in
the fetal savant’s withered
body, the victim is
effectively :ref:`srd:paralyzed`
and helpless.
