Drakon
------

*These winged snakes are coastal beasts and sometimes confused
with true dragons or wyverns. They are neither, but quite deadly in
their own right.*

**Searing Acid.** Drakon fangs do not deliver venom; volatile
acid constantly burbles up from a drakon's stomach and
enhances its attacks. A caustic drool clings to creatures they bite,
and drakons can also belch clouds of searing vapor. Their lairs
reek with acidic vapors and droplets of searing liquid.

**Dissolving Gaze.** The gaze of a drakon can paralyze creatures
and dissolve them.

**Coastal Beasts.** Drakons lair along warm, largely
uninhabited coasts, where they explore the shores and the
coastal shelf, spending as much time above the waves as under
them. Fortunately, they rarely travel far inland.

**Dissolving Gaze.** When a creature
that can see the drakon’s eyes
starts its turn within 30
feet of the drakon,
the drakon can
force it to make a DC
13 Constitution saving
throw if the drakon isn’t
incapacitated and can
see the creature. On a
failed saving throw,
the creature takes 3 (1d6) acid damage, its hit point maximum
is reduced by an amount equal to the acid damage it takes
(which ends after a long rest), and it’s :ref:`srd:paralyzed` until the start
of its next turn. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes
at the start of its turn to avoid the saving throw. If the creature
does so, it can’t see the drakon until the start of its next turn,
when it chooses again whether to avert its eyes. If the creature
looks at the drakon before then, it must immediately make the
saving throw.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The drakon makes one bite attack and one tail
attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (4d4) acid damage.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The drakon exhales acidic vapors
in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area takes 28 (8d6) acid
damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution
saving throw.
