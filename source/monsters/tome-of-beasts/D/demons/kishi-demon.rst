Kishi Demon
-----------

*This strong and handsome warrior has a snarling hyena’s face at
the back of its head.*

**Dark Appetites.** Kishi are two-faced male demons
perpetually driven by their voracious appetites, carnal or
otherwise, with a predilection for female humanoids. Kishi
frequently behead, scalp, or skin their conquests and decorate
their shields with their trophies.

**Hats and Veils.** Kishi demons typically masquerade as
muscular warriors or glib storytellers, wearing elaborate
headdresses or clan veils to hide the demonic hyena face on the
back of their head.

**Deadly Charmers.** They use magical and nonmagical means
of persuasion to inveigle women into their embrace, but their
trysts always end in a grisly feast upon their victim’s flesh.
