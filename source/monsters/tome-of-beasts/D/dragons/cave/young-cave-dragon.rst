**Tunneler.** The cave dragon can burrow through solid rock at
half its burrowing speed and leaves a 10-foot wide, 5-foot high
tunnel in its wake.

**Innate Spellcasting** The dragon’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following
spells, requiring no material components:

**1/day each:** :ref:`srd:blur`, :ref:`srd:counterspell`, :ref:`srd:web`

**3/day:** :ref:`srd:darkness`

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes three attacks; one with its bite
and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) poison damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.

**Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales a cone of
black poison gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area
must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (13d6)
poison damage on a failed save and becoming :ref:`srd:poisoned` if
it is a creature. The poisoned condition lasts until the target
takes a long or short rest or removes the condition with :ref:`srd:lesser-restoration`
or comparable magic. If the save is successful, the
target takes half damage and is not poisoned.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Ruff Spikes.** When a creature tries to enter a space adjacent to
a cave dragon, the dragon flares its many feelers and spikes.
The creature cannot enter a space adjacent to the dragon
unless it makes a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. If
the saving throw fails, the creature can keep moving but only
into spaces that aren’t within 5 feet of the dragon and takes 4
(1d8) piercing damage from spikes.
