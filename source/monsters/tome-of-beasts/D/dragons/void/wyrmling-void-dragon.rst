Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) cold damage.

**Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon uses one of the
following breath weapons.

  **Gravitic Breath.** The dragon exhales a 15-foot cube of
  powerful localized gravity, originating from the
  dragon. Falling damage in the area increases
  to 1d10 per 10 feet fallen. When a creature
  starts its turn within the area or enters it for
  the first time in a turn, including when the
  dragon creates the field, must make a DC
  13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure the
  creature is :ref:`srd:restrained`. On a success the
  creature’s speed is halved as long as it
  remains in the field. A restrained creature
  repeats the saving throw at the end of its
  turn. The field persists until the dragon’s
  breath recharges, and it can’t use
  gravitic breath twice consecutively.

  **Stellar Flare Breath.** The dragon
  exhales star fire in a 15-foot
  cone. Each creature in that
  area must make a DC 13
  Dexterity saving throw, taking
  10 (3d6) fire damage and 10
  (3d6) radiant damage on a
  failed save, or half as much
  damage on a successful one.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Void Twist.** When the dragon is hit by a ranged attack it can
create a small rift in space to increase its AC by 2 against that
attack. If the attack misses because of this increase the dragon
can choose a creature within 30 feet to become the new target
for that attack. Use the original attack roll to determine if the
attack hits the new target.
