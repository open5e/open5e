Dragon, Void
------------

*A dragon seemingly formed of the night sky has bright white stars
for eyes. Lesser stars twinkle in the firmament of the dragon’s body.*

**Children of the Stars.** Void dragons drift through the
empty spaces beyond the boundaries of the mortal world,
wanderers between the stars. They are aloof, mingling only with
the otherworldly beings that live above and beyond the earth,
including the incarnate forms of the stars themselves. When lesser
creatures visit void dragons, the dragons themselves barely notice.

**Witnesses to the Void.** Void dragons are intensely
knowledgeable creatures, but they have seen too much, lingering
at the edge of the void itself. Gazing into the yawning nothing
outside has taken a toll. The void dragons carry a piece of that
nothing with them, and it slowly devours their being. They are all
unhinged, and their madness is contagious. It flows out of them
to break the minds of lesser beings when the dragons fly into a
rage and lash out.

**Voracious Scholars.** Despite their removed existence and
strange quirks, void dragons still hoard treasure. Gems that
glitter like the stars of their home are particularly prized. Their
crowning piece, however, is knowledge. Void dragons jealously
hoard scraps of forbidden and forgotten lore of any kind and
spend most of their time at home poring over these treasures.
Woe to any who disturbs this collection, for nothing ignites their
latent madness like a violation of their hoard.

A Void Dragon’s Lair
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The true lair of a void dragon exists deep in the freezing, airless
void between stars. Hidden away in caves on silently drifting
asteroids or shimmering atop the ruins of a Star Citadel, the
void dragon’s lair rests in the great void of space.

When a void dragon claims a home elsewhere, it forges a
connection to its true lair. It prefers towering mountain peaks,
valleys, or ruins at high elevation with a clear view of the sky. It
can reach through space from this lair to reach its treasure hoard
hidden in the void. That connection has repercussions, of course,
and the most powerful void dragons leave their mark on the
world around them when they roost. Intrusions from beyond
and a thirst for proscribed knowledge are common near their
lairs.

If fought in its lair, its Challenge increases by 1, to 15 for an
adult (13,000 XP) and 25 for an ancient void dragon (75,000 XP).

Lair Actions
""""""""""""

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a
lair action to generate one of the following effects; the dragon
can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

* The dragon negates natural gravity within its lair (an area
  affected by its gravitic breath is unaffected). Creatures drift
  10 feet away from the ground over the course of a round and
  are restrained. Flying creatures can move at half speed, unless
  they have the (hover) tag or use magical flight, in which case
  they move normally. This effect persists until initiative count
  20 on the following round.
* The Void briefly overlaps the dragon’s lair in a 20-foot-radius
  sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and
  pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the
  dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The area spreads
  around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air
  (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere
  when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving
  throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as
  much on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in
  the sphere takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. The sphere lasts until
  the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.
* The dragon rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures it can
  see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist in the same place.
  Space itself repels the creatures to their original positions.
  Each creature takes 16 (3d10) force damage and is knocked
  :ref:`srd:prone`, or takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone
  with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.

Regional Effects
""""""""""""""""

The region containing a legendary void dragon’s lair is warped
by the dragon’s magic, which creates one or more of the
following effects:

* Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair.
  Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint
  at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for
  forbidden knowledge.
* Light is muted within 6 miles of the lair. Nonmagical
  illumination, including sunlight, can’t create bright light in
  this area.
* Visitations from otherworldly beings occur and disembodied
  voices whisper in the night within 6 miles of the dragon’s lair.
  Celestials, fey, and fiends of CR 2 or lower can slip into the
  world in this area.

If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.
