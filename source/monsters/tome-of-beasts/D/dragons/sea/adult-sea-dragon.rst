Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then
makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 18 (2d10 + 7) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) cold damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 14 (2d6 + 7) slashing damage.

**Tail.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the dragon’s choice that
is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed
on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become :ref:`srd:frightened` for
1 minute. A creature repeats the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a
creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it,
the creature is immune to the dragon’s Frightful Presence for
the next 24 hours.

**Tidal Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales a crushing
wave of frigid seawater in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that
area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure,
the target takes 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage and 33 (6d10)
cold damage, and is pushed 30 feet away from the dragon and
knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. On a successful save the creature takes half as
much damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone.

Legendary Actions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options below. Only one legendary action option can be used
at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The
dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings.
Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a
DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning
damage and be knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. The dragon can then move up
to half its flying speed, or half its swim speed if in the water.
