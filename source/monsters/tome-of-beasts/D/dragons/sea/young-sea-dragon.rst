Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The dragon makes three attacks: one with its bite
and two with its claws.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) cold damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage.

**Tidal Breath (Recharge 5-6).** The dragon exhales a crushing
wave of frigid seawater in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that
area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure,
the target takes 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage and 27 (5d10)
cold damage, and is pushed 30 feet away from the dragon and
knocked :ref:`srd:prone`. On a successful save the creature takes half as
much damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone.
