Dragonleaf Tree
---------------

*The dragon-headed leaves of these oak trees sometimes rustle
despite the lack of wind, betraying a hint of their draconic power.*

**Gifts among Dragons.** These magnificent trees are imbued
with some characteristics of their draconic masters. While most
groves consist of only one type of dragonleaf tree, dragons
sometimes make gifts of them to cement a pact or as a show
of fealty. The dragon giving the tree relinquishes command of
the plant as part of the deal. This accounts for mixed groves
belonging to especially powerful dragon lords.

**Silent Guardians.** Dragonleaf trees use fairly simple tactics
to deter potential intruders. They remain motionless or allow
the breeze to jostle their leaves to appear inconspicuous. Once
enough targets enter the grove, the trees fire razor sharp leaves
at or breathe on their targets, adjusting their position to make
better use of their weapons.

**Long Memories.** Dragonleaf trees live up to 1,000 years. They
stand 15 feet tall and weigh 3,000 lb, but ancient specimens can
reach heights of 45 feet. Growing a new dragonleaf tree requires
a cutting from an existing tree at least 50 years old, which the
tree’s master imbues with power, sacrificing the use of its breath
weapon for a month. While this time barely registers on a dragon’s
whole lifespan, it still carefully considers the creation of a new
tree, for fear that others might discover its temporary weakness.

**Damage Immunities** A dragonleaf tree enjoys the same
immunities as its progenitor. Black, copper, and green trees
are immune to acid damage; blue and bronze trees are
immune to lightning damage; brass, gold, and red trees
are immune to fire damage; and silver and white trees are
immune to cold damage.

**Condition Immunities** blinded, deafened

**Senses** blindsight 120 ft., passive Perception 11

**Languages** can understand the language of its
creator or designated master

**Challenge** 8 (3,900 XP)

**Loyal to Dragon Master.** A dragonleaf tree only follows
commands from its designated master (or from any creatures
to whom the master grants control). It has advantage on
saving throws against any charm or compulsion spell or effect.
Additionally, the tree has advantage on any saving throw to
resist Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate checks made to influence
it to act against its masters.

**Weaknesses.** Dragonleaf trees with immunity to fire also have
vulnerability to cold, and trees with immunity to cold have
vulnerability to fire.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 58 (10d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage.

**Leaves.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 45 (10d8) slashing damage.

**Breath Weapon (Recharge 6).** A dragonleaf tree can issue forth
a breath weapon from its leaves appropriate to the dragon
it honors. The creature’s breath weapon deals 49 (14d6)
damage, or half damage to targets that make a successful
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A black, copper, or green tree
breathes a 60-foot line of acid; a blue or bronze tree breathes
a 60-foot line of lightning; a brass, gold, or red tree breathes a
30-foot cone of fire; and a silver or white tree breathes a
30-foot cone of cold.
