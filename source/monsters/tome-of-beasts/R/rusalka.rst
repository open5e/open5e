Rusalka
-------

*A barefoot woman with long hair and almost transparent skin sits
upon a willow branch. Her hair and clothing are wet, as if she has
just returned from a swim. Her smile seems friendly enough.*

When a woman drowns, her dripping body may rise again as a
rusalka. Some claim the drowning must be a suicide. Others say
that the water itself must be tainted with murder or some great
evil spirit.

**Near Water.** Rusalkas dwell in the water where they died,
emerging only at night. Some climb a nearby tree, dangle their
feet in the water, and sing alluring songs. Others sit on the
bank, combing their wet tresses and awaiting prey. They must,
however, remain in or near the water where they died, as part of
their curse. However, during a full moon, the rusalki can leave
the water to dance along the shore or the riverbank, singing all
night long and inviting young men to join them.

**Songs and Poetry.** Rusalkas mesmerize and seduce passersby
with song and dance and poetry. Young men are their usual
victims, but they also prey on curious children, lonely older men,
and other heartbroken women. When a potential victim comes
near enough, the rusalki entangles the person with her hair and
drags him or her beneath the water to drown.

**Lover’s Walks.** A rusalka cannot pass for human on any but
the darkest night, but she might claim to be a lonely tree spirit
or a benevolent nymph willing to grant a wish in exchange for
a kiss. She may part the water of a lake and coax her victim
toward the center with the promise of a kiss—delivered as
her hair entraps the victim and the water rushes around him.
Alternatively, she may use water walk so she and the victim can
stroll across the surface of the water, reward him with a long kiss
(to prevent him from catching a deep breath), then end the spell
over deep water and drag him to the bottom.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Breathless Kiss.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* the target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC 13) and the
rusalka draws all the air from the target’s lungs with a kiss. If
the rusalka has movement remaining, she drags the grappled
creature into deep water, where it begins :ref:`srd:suffocating`.

**Drowning Hair (1/Day).** The rusalka’s long hair tangles around
a creature the rusalka has grappled. The creature takes 33
(6d10) necrotic damage, or half damage with a successful DC
15 Constitution saving throw. In addition, until it escapes the
rusalka’s grapple, it is :ref:`srd:restrained` and has disadvantage on
Strength checks to break free of the grapple.
