Ramag
-----

*These few denizens of a blasted desert waste now huddle in the
remains of an ancient city—a city magically scattered across
hundreds of miles.*

**Once Human.** The ramag were a powerful tribe of dimensional
sorcerers allied with a great society of titans, and they were
indeed human in ages past. Over time, strange practices warped
them into their current state, and they are clearly no longer
purely human. Their limbs grow too long in proportion to their
bodies, giving them a stooped, odd posture. Their features are
angular, and a ramag’s hair is impossibly thick; each strand is the
width of a human finger. They wear their strange
hair tied back in decorative clasps.

**Studious and Powerful.** Although physically weak, the
ramag are sharp-witted, studious, and naturally infused with
magic. Lifetimes of exposure to the warping effect of their
runaway magical energy have given the ramag innate control
over magic, as well as sharp resistance to it. They are acutely
aware of their responsibility for keeping magic in check, and
fully know the danger of uncontrolled magical energies. Even
the the lowliest ramag has a sharp intellect and a natural
understanding of magic.

Many ramag take up the study of wizardry. Few become
wandering adventurers, but well-equipped expeditions
sometimes leave their homeland to inspect the surrounding
countryside.
