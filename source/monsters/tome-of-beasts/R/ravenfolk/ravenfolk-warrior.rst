**Rune Weapons.** Kept keen with runic magic, runespears and
runestaves are two-handed weapons that count as magical,
though they provide no bonus to attack. Their magic must be
renewed each week by a doom croaker or by Odin’s own hand.

**Mimicry.** Ravenfolk warriors can mimic the voices of others
with uncanny accuracy. They have advantage on Charisma
(Deception) checks involving audible mimicry.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** A ravenfolk warrior makes two runespear attacks,
or two longbow attacks, or one ghost wings attack and one
runespear attack. It can substitute one peck attack for any
other attack.

**Ghost Wings.** The ravenfolk warrior furiously “beats” a set of
phantasmal wings. Every creature within 5 feet of the ravenfolk
must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be
:ref:`srd:blinded` until the start of the ravenfolk’s next turn.

**Longbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack.* +5 to hit, range 150/600 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

**Peck.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.

**Radiant Runespear.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 10
ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d12 + 1) piercing damage plus 2 (1d4)
radiant damage.

Variant: Lack of Runes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some ravenfolk warriors have no access to the runes. They use
rapiers instead.

**Rapier:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Odin’s Call.** A ravenfolk warrior can disengage after an attack
reduces it to 10 hp or less.
