Risen Reaver
------------

*A body that might once have been human now has four legs and
nightmarishly long, thick arms. What’s worse, its skin has been
flayed off, revealing the dead muscle and sinew beneath.*

**Spirt of War.** The risen reaver is an undead born from a
warrior fallen on the battlefield. Its body becomes an avatar of
combat, with four legs and a pair of long, heavy arms. In the
process, it sheds its skin, becoming entirely undead muscle,
bone, and sinew.

**Absorb Weapons.** When risen reavers take form, they absorb
all weapons around them. Some of these weapons pierce their
bodies, and others become part of the risen reaver’s armament.
Their four legs are tipped with blades on which they walk like
metallic spiders. Their arms are covered in weaponry infused
into their flesh, which they use to crush and flay any living
creatures they encounter.

**Battle Mad.** Risen reavers are battle‑maddened spirits of
vengeance and slaughter, obsessed with the chaos of combat that
led to their own death. They hunt the living with the sole purpose
of killing, and they thrive on violence and murder. As they died,
so should others die.

**Undead Nature.** A risen reaver doesn't require air, food,
drink, or sleep.
