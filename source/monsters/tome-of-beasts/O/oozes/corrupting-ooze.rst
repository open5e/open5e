Corrupting Ooze
---------------

*A corrupting ooze boils and bubbles with rank marsh gas and the
fetid stench of the sewer, and it leaves a stinking trail of acidic
slime wherever it goes.*

**Swim and Walk.** A corrupting ooze is a festering slime that can
slither and even swim like a gigantic sea slug, or it can assume
a roughly humanoid form and shamble through the streets,
though its stench and its lack of speech make it unlikely that
anyone might mistake it for a normal person. They are frequently
soldiers and servants to heralds of blood and darkness.

**Dissolve Bones.** A corrupting ooze can absorb an entire large
animal or small person, simply dissolving everything including
the bones in a matter of minutes. This function makes them an
important element of certain dark rituals.

**Corrupting Touch.** When a corrupting ooze scores a critical
hit or starts its turn with a foe :ref:`srd:grappled`, it can dissolve one
leather, metal, or wood item of its choosing in the possession
of the target creature. A mundane item is destroyed
automatically; a magical item is destroyed if its owner fails to
make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw.

**Strong Swimmer.** A corrupting ooze naturally floats on the
surface of water. It swims with a pulsating motion that propels
it faster than walking speed.
