Hound of the Night
------------------

*These enormous black hounds are most commonly seen panting in
the moonlight, wisps of steam rising from their muzzles, while they
accompany a nocturnal hunting party.*

**Fey Bloodhounds.** Hounds of the night are bred by
the shadow fey for use as hunting companions and
guardians, and they excel at both tasks. Far more
intelligent than other hounds, they are difficult to
evade once they are on a quarry’s trail, because they
can think their way past problems that would
throw their lesser kin off the trail. Their
shadow fey masters claim that
hounds of the night can smell
a shadow on running water
and can sniff out a ghost
passing through a wall.

**Cousins to Winter.** Somewhere in their early
existence as a breed, some enterprising hunter
interbred them with winter wolves. Every trace of their
white fur is long gone, but the cold breath of those dread
canines remains.

**Dimensional Stepping.** Hounds of night excel at
distracting prey while some of their pack uses
dimension door to achieve some larger goal, such as
dragging off a treasure or overwhelming a
spellcaster in the back ranks.
