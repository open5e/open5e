Herald of Darkness
------------------

*Stunningly tall and beautiful fiends, the heralds of darkness resemble
dark-haired fey wearing cloaks and armor glittering with dark light and
often surrounded by a nimbus of pale green fire.*

Heralds of darkness speak in fluid tones and sing with the voices
of angels, but their hearts are foul and treacherous.

**Vision of Evil.** Indeed, the heralds of darkness can take on
another appearance entirely, disappearing into insubstantial
shadows and unveiling an evil majestic form that leaves those
who see it shaken and weak—and often blind. Speaking of this
form is difficult, but poets and bards trying to describe it have
said it resembles an apocalyptic horror built of chained souls and
the slow death of children carried along in a glacial river, rushing
to an inevitable doom.

**Sword and Cloak.** The black sword and star-scattered cloak
of a herald of darkness are part of its magical substance and
cannot be parted from it. Some believe the cloak and blade are
true visions of its body; the smiling face and pleasing form are
entirely illusory.

**Corruptors of the Fey.** The heralds of darkness are
companions and sometimes masters to the shadow fey. They
seek to draw many others into their orbit with wild promises of
great power, debauchery, and other delights. They are rivals to
the heralds of blood and bitter foes to all angels of light.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The herald of darkness uses Majesty of the Abyss,
if it is available, and makes one melee attack.

**Embrace Darkness.** *Melee Weapon Attack.* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
all creatures in reach. *Hit:* 6 (1d12) necrotic damage and targets
are :ref:`srd:paralyzed` until the start of the herald’s next turn. Making a
DC 17 Constitution saving throw negates the paralysis.

**Majesty of the Abyss (Recharge 4-6).** The herald of darkness
emits a sinister burst of infernal power. All creatures within
30 feet and in direct line of sight of the herald take 19 (3d12)
necrotic damage and must make a DC 17 Constitution saving
throw. Those who fail the saving throw are :ref:`srd:blinded` for 2
rounds; those who succeed are :ref:`srd:frightened` for 2 rounds.

**Shadow Sword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 18 (2d12 + 5) slashing damage.
