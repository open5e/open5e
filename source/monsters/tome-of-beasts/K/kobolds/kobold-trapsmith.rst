Kobold Trapsmith
----------------

*This kobold is bedecked in satchels, pouches, sacks, and bandoliers.
All of these are bursting with tools, bits of scrap, wire, cogs and
twine. Impossibly large eyes blink through the lenses of its goggles.*

Some kobolds hatch a bit cleverer than their counterparts.
These sharp-witted creatures feel driven to fiddle with the world,
and those that don’t meet an early demise through accident or
violence often take up tinkering. Trapsmiths make a kobold lair
into a deadly gauntlet of hidden pain.

**Shifting Peril.** Trapsmiths aren’t warriors; they avoid
direct confrontation with enemies that aren’t mired in traps or
engaged with other foes. If the trapsmith senses that invaders in
its lair are likely to get past its traps, it tries to hide or escape.

A trapsmith delights in laying traps and snares behind invaders,
along tunnels and paths they’ve already cleared and believe to be
safe, then luring them back through its handiwork.

**Skills** Stealth +5

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** While in sunlight, the kobold trapsmith
has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception)
checks that rely on sight.

**Pack Tactics.** The kobold trapsmith has advantage on attack
rolls against a creature if at least one of the trapsmith’s allies is
within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.

**Thief’s Tools.** The kobold trapsmith has proficiency with thief’s
tools and is seldom without them. If its tools are taken away or
lost, it can cobble together a new set from wire, bits of metal,
and other junk in 30 minutes.

**Traps and Snares.** The kobold trapsmith excels at setting
mechanical traps. Detecting, disarming, avoiding, or mitigating
its traps require successful DC 13 checks or saving throws,
and the traps have +5 attack bonuses. With thief’s tools and
basic construction materials, a trapsmith can set up one of the
simple but effective traps listed below in 5 minutes. Triggers
involve pressure plates, tripwires, small catches in a lock, or
other simple mechanisms.

* *Choke Bomb.* This small incendiary device burns rapidly
  and releases choking smoke in
  a 20-foot sphere. The area
  is heavily obscured. Any
  breathing creature that’s
  in the affected area when the cloud is created or that starts
  its turn in the cloud is :ref:`srd:poisoned`. Once a poisoned creature
  leaves the cloud, it makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw
  at the end of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on a
  success. The smoke dissipates after 10 minutes, or after 1
  round in a strong wind.
* *Poisoned Sliver.* A poisoned sliver or needle can be hidden
  almost anywhere: inside a lock or a box, in a carpeted
  floor, on the underside of a door handle, in a cup of liquid
  or a bowl of gems. When someone meets the conditions
  for being jabbed by the sliver, the trap makes a melee
  weapon attack with advantage: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one
  target; *Hit:* 2 (1d4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) poison
  damage, or one-half poison damage with a successful DC 13
  Constitution saving throw.
* *Skullpopper.* This trap consists of either a heavy weight,
  a spike, or a blade, set to fall or swing into a victim. When
  triggered, a skullpopper makes a melee weapon attack
  against the first target in its path: +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one
  target; *Hit:* 11 (2d10) damage. The type of damage depends
  on how the skullpopper is built: a stone or heavy log does
  bludgeoning damage, a spiked log does piercing damage, a
  scything blade does slashing damage, etc.
* *Slingsnare.* A concealed loop of rope or wire is affixed to
  a counterweight. When a creature steps into the snare, it
  must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or
  be yanked into the air and suspended, upside down, 5 feet
  above the ground. The snared creature is :ref:`srd:restrained` (escape
  DC 13). The cord is AC 10 and has 5 hit points.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Dagger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.

**Light Crossbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range
80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus
7 (2d6) poison damage, or one-half poison damage with a
successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw.

**Shredder (Recharge 6).** The kobold trapsmith primes and
throws a device at a point within 30 feet. The device explodes
when it hits something solid, flinging razor-sharp spikes in
a 15-foot-radius sphere. Every creature in the area takes 14
(4d6) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13
Dexterity saving throw. The ground inside the spherical area is
littered with spikes; it becomes difficult terrain, and a creature
that falls prone in the area takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage.

**Stunner (1/Day).** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 20/60
ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the
target is :ref:`srd:restrained` (escape DC 13). While restrained, the target
takes 7 (2d6) lightning damage at the start of its turn and falls
prone. The trapsmith has advantage on the attack roll if the
target is wearing metal armor. A stunner is a bola made of
metal wire, magnets, and static electricity capacitors. A kobold
trapsmith can recharge it during a long rest.
