Bastet Temple Cat
-----------------

*A slim feline far larger than any house cat slips from the shadows.
Its coat glistens like ink as it chirps, and its tail flicks teasingly as
its golden eyes observe the doings in its temple.*

**Bred for Magic.** Temple cats of Bastet are thought by some
to be celestials, but they are a terrestrial breed, created by the
priesthood through generations of enchantment.

**Lazy Temple Pets.** By day, temple cats laze about their shrines
and porticos, searching out attention from the faithful and
occasionally granting boons when it suits then.

**Fierce Shrine Guardians.** By night, they serve as guardians
in their temples, inciting would-be thieves to come close before
viciously mauling them. More than one would-be rogue has met
his or her fate at the claws and teeth of these slim, black-furred
beasts. Bastet temple cats are fierce enemies of temple dogs.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The temple cat’s innate spellcasting
ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with
spell attacks). The temple cat can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:guidance`

**3/day each:** :ref:`srd:charm-person`, :ref:`srd:cure-wounds`

**1/day:** :ref:`srd:enhance-ability` (only Cat’s Grace)

**Priestly Purr.** When a cleric or paladin who worships
Bastet spends an hour preparing spells while a Bastet
temple cat is within 5 feet, that spellcaster can choose two
1st-level spells and one 2nd-level spell that they are able
to cast and imbue them into the temple cat. The temple cat
can cast these spells 1/day each without a verbal component.
These spells are cast as if they were included in the temple
cat’s Innate Spellcasting trait.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The temple cat makes one bite attack and one
claws attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 6 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage.

**Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.

**Fascinating Lure.** The temple cat purrs loudly, targeting a
humanoid it can see within 30 feet that can hear the temple
cat. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw
or be :ref:`srd:charmed`. While charmed by the temple cat, the target
must move toward the cat at normal speed and try to pet it
or pick it up. A charmed target repeats the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful, the creature
is immune to the temple cat’s Fascinating Lure for the next 24
hours. The temple cat has advantage on attack rolls against
any creature petting or holding it.
