Bouda
-----

*A hulking, hyena-faced humanoid with heavily scarred, oversized
muzzle, a bouda looks as if its jaw had once been ripped apart and
put back together. Clouds of gnats and fleas roil around its arms.*

**Glowing Eyes and Teeth.** Bouda are child-eaters, despoilers
of purity and family. Resembling oversized gnolls, a web of scars
along their muzzles is evidence of their gluttonous eating habits.
Forever leering, their teeth glow as yellow as their eyes.

**Fly-Bedecked Shapechangers.** Bouda lurk on society’s
fringes, shapechanging to blend in with mortals. They seek out
happy families, consuming the children in the night and leaving
gruesome trophies behind. They may mark a victim nights
before attacking to terrify the helpless parents.

**Gluttons.** Bouda have a weakness: they are incorrigible
gluttons. When presented with a fresh corpse, even in combat,
they will attempt to gorge on it or at least defile it for later
consumption. Bouda are vindictive, seeking revenge on
anything that drives them from a kill.

**Shapechanger.** The bouda can use its action to polymorph into
a human, a hyena, or its true form, which is a hyena-humanoid
hybrid. Its statistics, other than its Mephitic Claw attack, are
the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying
isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if destroyed, before
turning to dust.

**Defiling Smear (1/Day).** The bouda can secrete a disgusting
whitish-yellow substance with the viscosity of tar to mark food
and territory. As a bonus action, the bouda marks a single
adjacent 5-foot space, object, or helpless creature. Any
living creature within 30 feet of the smear at the start of its
turn must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw
against poison or be poisoned for 1d6 rounds. A creature
that makes a successful saving throw is immune to that
particular bouda’s defiling smear for 24 hours. The
stench of a smear remains potent for one week.

**Innate Spellcasting.** The bouda’s innate spellcasting ability is
Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). It can
cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**Constant:** :ref:`srd:detect-evil-and-good`, :ref:`srd:detect-magic`

**At will:** :ref:`srd:thaumaturgy`

**3/day:** :ref:`srd:darkness`, :ref:`srd:expeditious-retreat`

**1/day:** :ref:`srd:contagion`

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The bouda makes one bite attack and one
mephitic claw attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*
13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage.

**Mephitic Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage, and the target must
make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become
:ref:`srd:poisoned` for 1 round by the visible cloud of vermin swarming
around the bouda’s forearms.

**Ravenous Gorge.** The bouda consumes the organs of a corpse
in a space it occupies. It gains temporary hit points equal to
the dead creature’s HD that last 1 hour. Organs consumed by
this ability are gone, and the creature can’t be restored to life
through spells and magical effects that require a mostly intact
corpse.
