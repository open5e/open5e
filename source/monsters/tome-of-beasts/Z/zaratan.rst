Zaratan
-------

*One of the rocks suddenly lurches, and rises out of the water. A
great eye glides open in the side of what seemed to be a boulder, and
a massive, beaklike mouth gapes in the surf.*

**Island Reefs.** The zaratan is an impossibly huge sea turtle
so large that entire ecosystems develop and grow on its stony,
mountainous shell. Drifting on warm ocean currents or settled
on shoals, they are often mistaken for small tropical islands. The
creature’s head is at least 100 feet in diameter, with a ridge in the
center like a tall hill. Its head resembles a massive boulder, and
its 200-foot long flippers are mistaken for reefs.

**Ageless Slumber.** Zaratans spend their millennia-long
lives in slumber. They drift on the surface of the ocean, their
mouths slightly open, and reflexively swallow larger creatures
that explore the “cave.” They spend centuries at a time asleep. A
zaratan may know secrets long lost to the world, if only it can be
awakened and bargained with.

**Deep Divers.** Waking a zaratan is a dangerous proposition, as
their usual response to any injury severe enough to waken them
is to dive to the crushing black depths. Some zaratan commune
with oceanic races in this time, such as deep ones, sahuagin, or
aboleth.

**Fortified Shell.** The zaratan ignores any attack against its shell
that doesn’t do 30 points of damage or more. Attacking the
zaratan’s head or flippers bypasses this trait.
Endless Breath. The zaratan breathes air, but it can hold
its breath for years.

**False Appearance.** While the zaratan remains
motionless on the surface of the ocean
(except for drifting) it is indistinguishable
from a small island.

**Siege Monster.** The zaratan does
double damage to objects
and structures.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The zaratan makes one bite attack and two flipper
attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +18 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 26 (3d10 + 10) piercing damage and the target is :ref:`srd:grappled`
(escape DC 20). Until the grapple ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained`
and the zaratan can’t bite another target.

**Flipper.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +18 to hit, reach 15 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 19 (2d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage and the target
must succeed on a DC 26 Strength saving throw or be pushed
10 feet away from the zaratan.

**Swallow.** The zaratan makes one bite attack against a Huge
or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target
takes 26 (3d10 + 10) piercing damage, is swallowed, and the
grapple ends. A swallowed creature is :ref:`srd:blinded` and :ref:`srd:restrained`,
but has total cover against attacks and effects outside the
zaratan. A swallowed creature takes 28 (8d6) acid damage at
the start of each of the zaratan’s turns. The zaratan can have
any number of creatures swallowed at once.

If the zaratan takes 40 damage or more on a single turn
from a creature inside it, the zaratan must succeed on a DC 20
Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate
all swallowed creatures, which fall :ref:`srd:prone` in a space within 10
feet of the zaratan. If the zaratan dies, swallowed creatures
are no longer restrained and can escape by using 30 feet of
movement, exiting :ref:`srd:prone`.
