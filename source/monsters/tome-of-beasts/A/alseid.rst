Alseid
------

*Alseids are the graceful woodland cousins to centaurs, with the
slender upper body of an elf and the lower body of a deer. Because
they are rarely seen far from the wooded glades they call home,
they are sometimes called “grove nymphs,” despite being more
closely related to elves than nymphs.*

**Forest Guardians.** Alseids see the forest as an individual
and a friend. They are suspicious of outsiders who do not
share this view. Lost travelers who demonstrate deep
respect for the forest may spot a distant alseid’s white tail;
if they chase after it as it bounds away, the sympathetic
alseid may lead it toward a road or trail that can carry
them out of the forest. Disrespectful strangers may
follow the same tail to their doom. Alseids have no
compunction about slaughtering trespassers who burn
or cut down their forest.

**Antlers Show Status.** Alseids have antlers growing
from their foreheads. These antlers grow very slowly,
branching every 10 years for the first century of life.
Further points only develop with the blessing of the
forest. No fourteen-point imperial alseids are known
to exist, but many tribes are governed by princes with
thirteen points. Because antlers signify status, alseids never
use them in combat. Cutting an alseid’s antlers entirely off or
just removing points is a humiliating and grave punishment.

**White-Tailed Wanderers.** Alseids have a deep connection
with forest magic of all kinds, and their leaders favor the druid
and ranger classes.
