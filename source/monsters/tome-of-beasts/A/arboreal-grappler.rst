Arboreal Grappler
-----------------

*Long, simian arms snake through the trees like furred serpents,
dangling from a shaggy, striped ape in the leafy canopy above and
trying to snare those below.*

An arboreal grappler is a malformed creation of the gods,
a primate whose legs warped into long, muscular tentacles
covered in shaggy, red fur.

**Carry Prey to the Heights.** Arboreal grapplers use their
long limbs to snatch prey and drag it behind them as they use
their powerful forelimbs to ascend to the highest canopy. Their
victims are constricted until their struggles cease and then are
devoured. Their flexible tentacles are ill-suited for terrestrial
movement; they must drag themselves clumsily across open
ground too wide to swing across.

**Clans in the Canopy.** Arboreal grappler tribes build family
nests decorated with bones and prized relics of past hunts. These
nests are built high in the jungle canopy, typically 80 feet or
more above the ground. Clans of 40 or more spread across crude
villages atop the trees; in such large settlements, a third of
the population are juveniles. These nests are difficult to
spot from the ground; a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)
check is required. A creature observing an arboreal
grappler as it climbs into or out of a nest has
advantage on the check.

**Carnivorous Elf Hunters.** Grapplers
are carnivorous and prefer humanoid flesh,
elves in particular. Some suggest this arises
from hatred as much as from hunger, a cruel
combination of fascination and revulsion for
the walking limbs of humanoid creatures.

two tentacle attacks.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.

of which can grapple one target. When the arboreal grappler
moves, it can drag a Medium or smaller target it is grappling
at full speed.
