Anubian
-------

*An anubian’s swirling sand comes together to form a snarling,
canine-faced humanoid whose eyes shine with an eerie, blue glow.
Anubians are elementals summoned to guard tombs or protect
treasures.*

**Piles of Dust.** An anubian at rest resembles a pile of sand or
dust, often strewn about an already dusty location. When active,
it rises up to form a muscular humanoid with the head of a
jackal. A destroyed anubian collapses into an inert pile of sand.

**Death to the Unarmored.** In combat, anubians prefer to
fight unarmored foes rather than creatures wearing armor.
They associate unarmored creatures with spellcasters, and
their latent resentment over centuries of being summoned as
servants drives them to attack such figures when they aren’t
shackled by magical bondage.

**Sandstorm Tag Teams.** Anubians fight effectively as teams,
using their haboob attacks to corner and isolate the most
vulnerable targets.

**Elemental Nature.** An anubian doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

**Sand Step.** Instead of moving, the anubian’s humanoid form
collapses into loose sand and immediately reforms at another
unoccupied space within 10 feet. This movement doesn’t
provoke opportunity attacks. After using this trait in sand
terrain, the anubian can Hide as part of this movement even
if under direct observation. Anubians can sand step under
doors or through similar obstacles, provided there’s a gap
large enough for sand to sift through.

**Vulnerability to Water.** For every 5 feet the anubian
moves while touching water or for every gallon of
water splashed on it, it takes 2 (1d4) cold damage.
An anubian completely immersed in water takes 10
(4d4) cold damage at the start of its turn.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The anubian makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**Haboob (1/Day).** The anubian creates a sandstorm in a cylinder
30-feet high, that reaches to within 5 feet of it. The storm
moves with the anubian. The area is heavily obscured, and
each creature other than an anubian that enters the sandstorm
or ends its turn there must make a successful DC 13 Strength
saving throw or be :ref:`srd:restrained` by it. Also, each creature other
than an anubian that ends its turn inside the sandstorm
takes 3 (1d6) slashing damage. The anubian can maintain the
haboob for up to 10 minutes as if concentrating on a spell.
While maintaining the haboob, the anubian’s speed is reduced
to 5 feet and it can’t sand step. Creatures restrained by the
sandstorm move with the anubian. A creature can free itself or
an adjacent creature from the sandstorm by using its action
and making a DC 13 Strength check. A successful check ends
the restraint on the target creature.
