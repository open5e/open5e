Angler Worm
-----------

*As patient as a fisherman, the angler worm lights a beacon in the
darkness and waits for its next meal.*

**Silk Snares.** The angler worm burrows into the ceilings of
caves and tunnels, where it creates snares from strong silk
threads coated with sticky mucus. It then lures prey into its
snares while remaining safely hidden itself, emerging only to
feed. With dozens of snares, food always comes to the angler
worm eventually.

**Senses** tremorsense 60 ft., passive Perception 12

**Languages** ­—

**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP)

**Spider Climb.** The worm can climb difficult surfaces,
including upside down on ceilings and along its
snare lines, without needing an ability check. The
angler worm is never restrained by its own or
other angler worms’ snare lines.

**Keen Touch.** The angler worm has advantage
on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely
on vibrations.

**Transparent Trap.** A successful DC 12
Wisdom (Perception) check must be made
to spot angler worm snare lines, and the
check is always made with disadvantage unless
the searcher has some means of overcoming
the snares’ invisibility. A creature that enters a
space containing angler worm snare lines must
make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or
be :ref:`srd:restrained` by the sticky snares (escape DC 14).
This saving throw is made with disadvantage if the
creature was unaware of the snare lines’ presence.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** An angler worm makes one bite attack.
It also makes one coils attack against every enemy
creature restrained by its threads and within reach of its
coils—once it has coiled around one creature it stops coil
attacks against others.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) acid damage.

**Coils.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 13 (3d8) acid damage, and the target creature must
make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be pulled
adjacent to the angler worm (if it wasn’t already) and :ref:`srd:grappled`
in the angler worm’s coils (escape DC 12). While grappled
this way, the creature is :ref:`srd:restrained` by the angler worm (but
not by its snare lines), it can’t breathe, and it takes 22 (5d8)
acid damage at the start of each of the angler worm’s turns. A
creature that escapes from the angler worm’s coils may need
to make an immediate DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid
being restrained again, if it escapes into a space occupied by
more snare lines.

**Ethereal Lure (Recharge 4-6).** The angler worm selects a spot
within 20 feet of itself; that spot glows with a faint, blue light
until the start of the worm’s next turn. All other creatures
that can see the light at the start of their turn must make a
successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be :ref:`srd:charmed` until
the start of their next turn. A creature charmed this way must
Dash toward the light by the most direct route, automatically
fails saving throws against being restrained by snare lines, and
treats the angler worm as :ref:`srd:invisible`.
