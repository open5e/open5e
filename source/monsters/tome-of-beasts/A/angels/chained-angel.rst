Chained Angel
-------------

*Their wings are still feathered, but their soulless eyes betray a great
rage and thirst for blood. They invariably wear chains, shackles,
barbed flesh hooks, or manacles to show their captive state. Some
have heavy chain leashes held by arch-devils or major demons.
All chained angels have halos of pure black, and many have been
flayed of their skin along one or more limbs.*

**Broken and Chained.** These angels have been captured
by fiends, tortured, and turned to serve darkness. A pack of
chained angels is considered a status symbol among the servants
of evil. A chained angel fights for the forces of evil as long as they
remain chained, and this amuses demons and devils greatly.

**Chance at Redemption.** However, while their souls are
tainted with the blood of innocents, in their hearts chained
angels still hope to be redeemed, or at least to be given the solace
of extinction. Any creature that kills a chained angel is given a
gift of gratitude for the release of death, in the form of all the
effects of a heroes' feast spell. If it cannot be redeemed, a chained
angel is a storm of destruction.

**Redemption.** Any caster brave enough to cast a knock spell
on a chained angel can remove the creature’s shackles—
but this always exposes the caster to a blast of unholy
flame as a reaction. The caster takes 16 (3d10) fire
damage and 16 (3d10) radiant damage, or half as much
with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. If the caster
survives, the angel makes an immediate DC 20 Wisdom saving
throw; if it succeeds, the angel’s chains fall away and it is
restored to its senses and to a Good alignment. If the saving
throw fails, any further attempts to cast knock on the angel’s
chains fail automatically for one week.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The chained angel makes two fiery greatsword
attacks.

**Fiery Greatsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack.* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage plus 16 (3d10)
fire damage.

**Fallen Glory (Recharge 5-6).** All creatures within 50 feet of the
chained angel and in its line of sight take 19 (3d12) radiant
damage and are knocked :ref:`srd:prone`, or take half damage and
aren’t knocked prone with a successful DC 15 Strength saving
throw.

Reaction
~~~~~~~~

**Fiendish Cunning.** When a creature within 60 feet casts a divine
spell, the chained angel can counter the spell if it succeeds on
a Charisma check against a DC of 10 + the spell’s level.
