Abominable Beauty
-----------------

*An otherworldly humanoid of such indescribable beauty, it pains
anyone’s eyes to gaze upon her.*

**Beauty that Destroys.** An abominable beauty is so perfect
that her gaze blinds, her voice is so melodious that no ears can
withstand it, and her touch is so tantalizing that it burns like
fire. In adolescence, this fey creature adopts features that meet
the superficial ideals of the nearest humanoid population:
long‑legged elegance near elves, a stout figure with lustrous hair
near dwarves, unscarred or emerald skin near goblins.

**Jealous and Cruel.** Abominable beauties are so consumed
with being the most beautiful creature in the region that they
almost invariably grow jealous and paranoid about potential
rivals. Because such an abominable beauty cannot abide
competition, she seeks to kill anyone whose beauty is compared
to her own.

**Male of the Species.** Male abominable beauties are rare
but even more jealous in their rages.
