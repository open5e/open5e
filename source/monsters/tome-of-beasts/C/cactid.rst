Cactid
------

*Rootlike tendrils explode from the sand at the base of this tall cactus
bristling with needles. It uses its tendrils to reach for prey.*

**Needled Sentients.** Cactids are semi-sentient cacti that
grow in a myriad of shapes and sizes, from ground-hugging
barrels and spheroid clumps that pin their victims to the ground
to towering saguaros with clublike arms that yank victims off
their feet. Most cactids are green or brown with distinct ribs; all
are lined with countless needles.

**Drain Fluids.** In addition to gathering water, a cactid's
tendril-roots can snag nearby creatures and pull them into a
deadly embrace. Once a creature is pinned, the cactid’s spines
siphon off the victim’s bodily fluids, until little but a dried husk
remains. Many cactids are adorned with bright flowers or
succulent fruit to lure prey into reach. Some scatter shiny objects
within reach to attract sentient creatures. For those traveling
the desert, however, a cactid’s greatest treasure is the water
stored within its flesh. A slain cactid’s body yields four gallons of
water with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. Failure
indicates that only one gallon is recovered.

**Slow Packs.** Cactids were created by a nomadic sect of druids,
but their original purpose is lost. They have limited mobility, so
they often congregate in stands or to travel together in a pack to
better hunting grounds.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The cactid makes two attacks with its tendrils and
uses Reel.

**Tendril.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., one
creature. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6)
piercing damage, and a Medium or smaller target is :ref:`srd:grappled`
(escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is :ref:`srd:restrained`.
If the target is neither undead nor a construct, the cactid drains
the target’s body fluids; at the start of each of the target’s
turns, the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, the creature’s hit point maximum is reduced
by 3 (1d6). If a creature’s hit point maximum is reduced to 0
by this effect, the creature dies. This reduction lasts until the
creature finishes a long rest and drinks abundant water or until
it receives a greater restoration spell or comparable magic. The
cactid has two tendrils, each of which can grapple one target
at a time.

**Reel.** Each creature grappled by the cactid is pulled up to 5 feet
straight toward the cactid.
