Cambium
-------

*Unfolding impossibly from beneath voluminous robes, this
creature’s pockmarked, spindly arms end in clusters of narrow
spikes. Its long, hollow, needle-like fingers and its many-jointed
arms move with surprising speed and strength for such an
emaciated creature.*

**Hunched and Robed.** The cambium skulks through mortal
society, hunched and contorted, concealing its nine-foot height
and its supernumerary arms.

**Devours Bodily Humors.** The source of a cambium’s interest
lies in every mortal body: the four humors, which it drains in
precise amounts, sometimes to fix its own imbalances, sometimes
to concoct serums meant for sale in hellish markets. Its victims
are left in a desperate state, eager for a corrective fix and willing to
obey the cambium’s every whim as servants and toadies.

**Abandons Victims.** After a sufficient crop has been harvested,
the cambium abandons these addicts to die slowly from violent
withdrawals, and allows the local population to lie fallow for a
decade or so.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The cambium makes four needle fingers attacks.

**Needle Fingers.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage. In addition, the
target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw; if it fails,
the cambium can either inflict Ability Damage or Imbalance
Humors. A target makes this saving throw just once per turn,
even if struck by more than one needle fingers attack.

**Ability Damage (3/Day).** When the target of the cambium’s
needle fingers fails its Constitution saving throw, one of its
ability scores (cambium’s choice) is reduced by 1d4 until it
finishes a long rest. If this reduces a score to 0, the creature is
unconscious until it regains at least one point.

**Imbalance Humors (3/Day).** When the target of the cambium’s
needle fingers fails its Constitution saving throw, apply one of
the following effects:

  **Sanguine Flux:** The target cannot be healed—naturally or
  magically—until after their next long rest.

  **Choleric Flux:** The target becomes confused (as the spell)
  for 3d6 rounds. The target can repeat the saving throw at
  the end of each of its turns to shrug off the flux before the
  duration ends.

  **Melancholic Flux:** The target is :ref:`srd:incapacitated` for 1d4 rounds
  and slowed (as the :ref:`srd:slow` spell) for 3d6 rounds. The target can
  repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns to
  shrug off the flux before the duration ends.

  **Phlegmatic Flux:** A successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw
  negates this effect. A failed saving throw means the target
  gains one level of :ref:`srd:exhaustion` which lasts for 3d6 rounds.
