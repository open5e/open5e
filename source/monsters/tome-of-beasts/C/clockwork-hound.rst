Clockwork Hound
---------------

*This black, mechanical hunting dog keeps its nose to the ground
sniffing and whuffling. Gleaming teeth fill its metal mouth.*

**Ticking Bloodhounds.** Partners to the clockwork
huntsmen, these black hounds follow the trails of criminals,
escaped slaves, and other unfortunates. Their infused spirits
are those of hunting hounds, and their animating magic allows
them to follow a scent with preternatural speed and accuracy.

**Toy Variants.** Some claim the infusion of animal spirits into
clockwork hounds was one of the great arcane discoveries that
made the creation of the gearforged possible; others say that
it has done nothing but make clockwork mages rich. Certainly
the earliest hounds were built for work and war, but the most
recent varieties also include some that are deceptively big-eyed
and painted as children’s toys or to match a young aristocrat’s
favorite outfit.

**Serve the Rulers.** Despite this brief flirtation with fashion,
most clockwork hounds continue to serve town watches, royal
huntsmen, road wardens, moneylenders, and criminal gangs as
loyal trackers and guards.

**Constructed Nature.** A clockwork hound doesn’t require
air, food, drink, or sleep.
