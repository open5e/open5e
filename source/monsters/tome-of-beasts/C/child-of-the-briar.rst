Child of the Briar
------------------

*Its eyes gleam like polished walnuts, and its sly smile seems
oddly placed on the tiny body, covered in spikes and thorns. The
creature’s waist is no thicker than a clenched fist, and its sinuous
arms are no wider than a finger but twice the length of its body.*

**Born of Magic.** Children of the briar are a frequent nuisance
to fey and mortal alike. They grow in deep briar patches in
forest clearings or along sunny hillsides and riverbanks.
More rarely, they spawn when a sorcerer or magical
creature’s blood is spilled on the forest floor, or
when summoned into being by obscure druidic
items of power.

**Thorn Fortresses.** Despite their size, children
of the briar gather in great numbers, cultivating
ancient forest thickets into veritable fortresses.
Wise men flee when they hear their clicking
language in the underbrush, for the children have all
the capricious wickedness of spiteful children and a taste
for blood.

**Spies and Scouts.** From their lairs, the children of the briar
creep far and wide to spy on the forest’s inhabitants, sometimes
using spiders, monstrous centipedes, and giant dragonflies as
mounts. They converse with travelers bearing interesting news,
but their words are thorned with gleeful malice, jealous bile, and
lies. They are not above murder. They trade news and gossip for
trinkets, favors, and drops of spilled blood.

The fey have long used the children of the briar as spies and
informants, and the power of the Otherworld now courses
through their veins, allowing them to work simple magical tricks
and slip between the mortal and faerie realms with relative ease.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** A child of the briar makes two claw attacks. If both
attacks hit the same target, the target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape DC
13) and the child of the briar uses its Thorny Grapple on it.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**Spitdart Tongue (Recharge 4-6).** *Ranged Weapon Attack:*
+5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing
damage. Every child of the briar can shoot thorns from its
mouth.

**Entangle.** Two children of the briar working together can cast
a version of the entangle spell with no components, at will.
Both creatures must be within 10 feet of each other, and both
must use their action to cast the spell. The entangled area
must include at least one of the casters but doesn’t need to
be centered on either caster. Creatures in the area must make
a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be :ref:`srd:restrained`. All children of
the briar are immune to the spell’s effects.

**Thorny Grapple.** A child of the briar’s long thorny limbs help
it grapple creatures up to Medium size. A grappled creature
takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage at the end of the child’s turn for
as long as it remains grappled.
