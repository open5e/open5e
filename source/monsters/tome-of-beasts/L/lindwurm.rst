Lindwurm
--------

*Coiling like a living corkscrew, moving with a scraping hiss,
a lindwurm’s serpentine form skates nimbly across ice on long
curving claws, maw agape and stinking of a hundred graves.*

**Swift and Smooth as Ice.** Lindwurms have long bodies and
crocodilian jaws, but they skitter overland on spindly limbs.
Their talons are long and curved, acting as skates or short skis
when moving over ice. Few things are swifter on the ice.

**Sea Hunters.** In the wild, lindwurms hunt in groups, looking
for breaching whales, seals, or incautious fishermen. They
employ wolf-pack tactics and enjoy surprising foes. With their
considerable cunning, they may skate by their prey at speed,
snapping a bite as they pass or snatching them up with their
constricting tails.

**Lindwurm Fever.** A creature infected with this disease by a
lindwurm’s bite gains one level of exhaustion an hour after
being infected. The creature must make a DC 14 Constitution
saving throw after each long rest. On a failure, the creature
gains one level of :ref:`srd:exhaustion` and recovers no hit dice from
the long rest. On a success, the creature recovers from one
level of exhaustion and regains hit dice normally. If the
infected creature reduces itself to zero exhaustion by making
successful saving throws, the disease is cured.

**Skittering Skater.** Lindwurms suffer no penalties from difficult
terrain on ice and are immune to the effects of the :ref:`srd:grease` spell.

**Snake Belly.** When lying with its sensitive stomach on the ice,
a lindwurm can sense approaching creatures by the vibrations
they cause, granting them tremorsense.
