Loxoda
------

*Often called elephant centaurs by humans and gnolls, loxodas are
massive creatures that combine the torso of an ogre and the body
of an elephant. Hating and fearing all strangers, they live in open
plains and scrubland.*

**Nomadic Families.** Loxodas live in small herds of 2-3
extended families. Several of these communities will usually
cluster together, allowing members to move between groups
as they get older. They have no permanent settlements, and
instead loxoda families travel to new areas when they deplete the
available food. Voracious eaters, a family of loxodas will quickly
strip trees bare of leaves, or hunt and cook an entire elephant.
They devour both meat and vegetation.

**Often Underestimated.** Many people assume that loxodas
are as dull witted as the ogres they resemble. This is often a fatal
mistake, as the elephant centaurs are quite intelligent. Their
simple equipment and straightforward living comes not from
a lack of skill or knowledge, but their own isolationism and
xenophobia. Their immense size and quadruped body makes
it difficult for them to mine metal ore, and they violently
reject communications and trade with other people. The
little metal they can gather is either taken from the
bodies of their prey or stolen in raids on dwarven,
human, or gnoll settlements.

**Vestigial Tusks.** All loxodas have curved tusks.
While they are too small for use in even ritual
combat, they are often decorated with intricate
carvings, inlays or dyed in a pattern developed
by their family. Each individual also adapts
the patterns with their own individual
marks, often inspired by important
events in their lives. Some loxodas put
golden rings or jewelled bracelets stolen
from humanoids onto their tusks as
trophies—a loxoda matriarch may have
long dangling chains of such ornaments,
indicating her high status and long life.
They stand 18 feet tall and weigh nearly
20,000 pounds.
