Steam Golem
-----------

*With wicked axe blades fastened along its arms and bronze runes
inlaid on its armored torso, a steam golem is a smooth-running
machine of death.*

**Boilers and Hydraulics.** A steam golem is built around
a central boiler with clockwork gears and hydraulic cylinders
powering its legs and arms. Most steam golems have axe blades
welded onto each of their arms, and many can extend one arm
into a single, long-hafted axe for additional reach. They tower 10
feet tall, and their legs are often built with reversed knee joints
for greater leverage when they move. The eyes of a steam golem
glow orange or red from its internal fires.

**Steam Whistle.** A steam golem has four to six vents for
releasing steam. These whistles are mounted over the shoulders
and can be heard at distances up to a mile in open terrain.

**Fuel Required.** A steam golem’s machinery consumes 30 lb.
of coal and 100 gallons of water per day if it engages in more
than brief combat. When resting or standing guard, a steam
golem needs just one third of those amounts.

**Constructed Nature.** A golem doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

**Boiler Weakness.** A steam golem that’s immersed in water or
whose boiler is soaked with at least 20 gallons of water (such as
from a water elemental) may be stopped in its tracks by the loss
of steam pressure in the boiler. In the case of a water elemental,
dousing a steam golem destroys the elemental and the golem
must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. If it succeeds, the
water instantly evaporates and the golem continues functioning
normally. If it fails, the golem’s fire is extinguished and the boiler
loses pressure. The steam golem acts as if affected by a :ref:`srd:slow`
spell for 1d3 rounds, then becomes :ref:`srd:paralyzed` until its fire is relit
and it spends 15 minutes building up pressure.

**Immutable Form.** The golem is immune to any spell or effect
that would alter its form.

**Extend Long Ax.** A steam golem can extend or retract one arm
into long ax form as a bonus action.

**Magic Resistance.** The golem has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The golem’s weapon attacks are magical.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The steam golem makes two ax arm attacks, or
one long axe attack.

**Ax Arm.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 22 (4d6 + 8) slashing damage.

**Long Axe.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 40 (5d12 + 8) slashing damage.

**Steam Blast (Recharge 5-6).** A steam golem can release a blast
of steam. The golem chooses whether to affect a 5-foot radius
around itself or a 20-foot cube adjacent to itself. Creatures in
the affected area take 38 (7d10) fire damage, or half damage
with a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw.

Reactions
~~~~~~~~~

**Whistle.** When an opponent within 30 feet of the golem
tries to cast a spell, the steam golem can emit a shriek from
its twin steam whistles. The spellcaster must make a DC 17
Constitution saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell is
cast normally. If it fails, the spell is not cast;
the spell slot is
not used, but
the caster’s
action is.
