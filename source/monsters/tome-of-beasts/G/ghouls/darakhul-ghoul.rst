**Master of Disguise.** A darakhul in a prepared disguise has
advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to pass as
a living creature. While using this ability, the darakhul loses
its stench.

**Stench.** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the
darakhul must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving
throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. A
successful saving throw makes the creature immune to the
darakhul’s stench for 24 hours. A darakhul using this ability
can’t also benefit from Master of Disguise.

**Sunlight Sensitivity.** The darakhul has disadvantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight and on attack rolls while
it, the object it is trying to see or attack in direct sunlight.

**Turning Defiance.** The darakhul and any ghouls within 30 feet
of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn
undead.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The darakhul bites once, claws once, and makes
one war pick attack. Using a shield limits the darakhul to
making either its claw or war pick attack, but not both.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage, and if the target creature
is humanoid it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving
throw or contract darakhul fever.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a creature
other than an undead, it must make a successful DC 12
Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`srd:paralyzed` for 1 minute. A
paralyzed target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a humanoid
creature is paralyzed for 2 or more rounds (the victim fails at
least 2 saving throws), consecutive or nonconsecutive, the
creature contracts darakhul fever.

**War Pick.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage.
