Shabti
------

*Wearing silver and red enamel pectoral jewelry and stylized
armlets, as well as carrying a thin, carved stick, this angular, dark-eyed
human appears almost normal. When it moves, gears clash
and whir faintly within it.*

**Lifelike Servants.** Shabti are constructs made to tend to the
needs of their masters in the afterlife. Dressed in ceremonial
regalia, they are sometimes mistaken for living beings by
intruders into their ancient tombs, though careful examination
reveals faintly glowing hieroglyphs graven into their garments
and their bodies.

**Insane Machines.** Usually driven mad by centuries within its
master’s tomb, a shabti fiercely attacks anything that threatens
its sworn charge. Some ceaselessly babble ancient scriptures or
invocations to the gods of death.

**Ancient Weapons.** A shabti fights by releasing its serpentine
armlets, then using telekinesis against spellcasters while
thrashing anyone within reach with archaic but effective stick-fighting
maneuvers. The shabti’s weapon, the nabboot, is a
4-foot stick made of rattan or bundled reeds; this weapon was
common in ancient forms of single-stick fighting. Shabti always
fight until destroyed.

**Constructed Nature.** A shabti slime doesn’t require air,
food, drink, or sleep.

that would alter its form.

**Magic Resistance.** The shabti has advantage on saving throws
against spells and other magical effects.

**Magic Weapons.** The shabti’s weapon attacks are magical.

**Serpentine Armlets.** As a bonus action, the shabti commands
its armlets to drop to the floor, whereupon they become two
:ref:`srd:giant-poisonous-snake`. The shabti can mentally direct the
serpents (this does not require an action). If the snakes are
killed, they dissolve into wisps of smoke which reform around
the shabti’s forearms, and they can’t be turned into snakes for
1 week. These armlets are linked to the shabti at the time of its
creation and do not function for other creatures.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The shabti uses Telekinesis and makes two attacks
with its nabboot.

**Nabboot.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 7 (1d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6)
necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with tomb
taint. The cursed target’s speed is reduced to half, and its hit
point maximum decreases by 3 (1d6) for every 24 hours that
elapse. If the curse reduces the target’s hit point maximum to
0, the target dies and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts
until removed by the remove curse spell or comparable magic.

**Telekinesis.** The shabti targets a creature within 60 feet. The
target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength check or the shabti
moves it up to 30 feet in any direction (including upward), and
it is :ref:`srd:restrained` until the end of the shabti’s next turn.
