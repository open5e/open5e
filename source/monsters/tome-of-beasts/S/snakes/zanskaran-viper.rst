Zanskaran Viper
---------------

*Greenish liquid drips from the dagger-length fangs of this
20-foot-long monstrosity. They show little fear.*

**Human Hunters.** This giant venomous snake is
known as one of the most lethal serpents, and one of the
few that will attack an adult human. One bite from the
Zanskaran viper can kill a healthy human in seconds,
and its tough hide makes it difficult to dispatch quickly.

**Jungle Bred.** A Zanskaran viper grows quickly in
its jungle home, and some even venture into the
savannah to terrorize antelopes and young giraffes.
A full-grown Zanskaran viper is up to 30 feet long
and weighs up to 400 pounds.

**Famous but Rare Venom.** A dose of its viscous green venom
is known to fetch as much as 2,500 gp on the black market, but it
is rarely available.
