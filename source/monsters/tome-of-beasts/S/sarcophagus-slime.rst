Sarcophagus Slime
-----------------

*The sarcophagus opens to reveal an eerie, scintillating light. Wisps
of gelid amber ectoplasm undulate outward from a quivering mass
with a blackened skull at its center.*

**Vigilant Slime.** Sarcophagus slimes are amorphous undead
guardians placed in the tombs of the powerful to guard them
and to wreak terrible vengeance on would-be defilers of
the ancient crypts. They seethe with baleful energy, and
their blackened skulls retain a simple watchfulness.

**Muddled Origins.** Many sages speculate that the
first sarcophagus slime was spawned accidentally, in a
mummy creation ritual that gave life to the congealed
contents of canopic jars rather than the intended,
mummified body. Others maintain sarcophagus slime
was created by a powerful necromancer-pharaoh bent on
formulating the perfect alchemical sentry to guard his crypt.

**Death to Tomb Robbers.** These ectoplasmic slimes are
the bane of burglars and a constant danger for excavators and
antiquarians exploring ruins or tombs. The rituals for their
creation have not been entirely lost; modern necromancers
still create these undead abominations for their own fell
purposes, and tomb robbers are turned into slimes if they
lack proper caution.

**Undead Nature.** A sarcophagus slime doesn’t require
air, food, drink, or sleep.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The sarcophagus slime uses its Frightful Presence,
uses its Corrupting Gaze, and makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (4d6) acid
damage.

**Frightful Presence.** Each creature of the sarcophagus slime’s
choice that is within 60 feet of the sarcophagus slime and aware
of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become
:ref:`srd:frightened` for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or
the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the sarcophagus
slime’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**Corrupting Gaze.** The sarcophagus slime targets one
creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see
the sarcophagus slime, the target must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) necrotic damage
and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to
the necrotic damage taken. If this effect reduces a creature’s
hit point maximum to 0, the creature dies and its corpse
becomes a sarcophagus slime within 24 hours. This reduction
lasts until the creature finishes a long rest or until it is affected
by :ref:`srd:greater-restoration` or comparable magic.
