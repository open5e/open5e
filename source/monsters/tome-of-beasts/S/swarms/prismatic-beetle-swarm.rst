Prismatic Beetle Swarm
----------------------

*A dazzling explosion of multicolored lights erupts from this cloud
of flying beetles, flashing every color of the rainbow.*

**Flesh-Eating Beauties.** The depths of the jungle are filled
with lethal wildlife, and prismatic beetles are superlative
examples of this. These flesh-eating, venomous insects
distract and subdue their prey with sparkling beauty even as
they devour it alive. Individual prismatic beetles sparkle like
precious gems in the light; tosculi traders, gnolls, and humans
often incorporate their carapaces into decorative jewelry
or utilize them as special components in enchantment and
illusion (pattern) spells and items.

**Hypno-Paralytic.** When swarming in the
thousands, these beautiful bugs create a
hypnotic cascade of glimmering hues
capable of enthralling creatures. As they
descend on their dazed prey, the beetles’
bites slowly paralyze their victims while
their toxins distract the mind with
feelings of euphoria and delight.

**Predator Partners.** Although
carnivorous, prismatic beetles are not
overly aggressive; they attack other creatures
only when hungry or threatened. Even when
they’re not attacking, however, they can be a threat;
more than one unwary traveler has stopped to admire
what they thought was a docile swarm of prismatic beetles,
and became captivated. The unfortunates are often killed and
eaten by lurking jungle predator, as such animals know the
beetles stun and confuse prey.

**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and
vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening
large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can’t regain hit
points or gain temporary hit points.

**Glittering Carapace.** The glossy, iridescent carapaces of
the beetles in the swarm scatter and tint light in a dazzling
exhibition of colors. In bright light, a creature within 30
feet that looks at the prismatic beetle swarm must make a
successful DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be :ref:`srd:blinded` until
the end of its next turn. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more,
the target is also knocked :ref:`srd:unconscious`. Unless it’s surprised,
a creature can avoid the saving throw by choosing to avert
its eyes at the start of its turn. A creature that averts its eyes
can’t see the swarm until the start of its next turn, when it
can choose to avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the
swarm in the meantime, it must immediately make the saving
throw. The saving throw is made with advantage if the swarm
of prismatic beetles is in dim light, and this ability has no effect
if the swarm is in darkness.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bites.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature
in the swarm’s space. *Hit:* 10 (4d4) piercing damage, or 5 (2d4)
piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
The target also takes 10 (4d4) poison damage and becomes
euphoric for 1d4 rounds, or takes half as much poison damage
and is not euphoric if it makes a successful DC 11 Constitution
saving throw. A euphoric creature has disadvantage on saving
throws.
