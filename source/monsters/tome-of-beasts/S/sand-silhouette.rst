Sand Silhouette
---------------

*Sand silhouettes are spirits of those who died in desperation in
sandy ground, buried during sandstorms, thrown into dry wells,
or the victims of a dune collapse. Looking like a shadow stretched
out along the ground, a sand silhouette’s erratic movements are
difficult to discern.*

**Sand Bodies.** If disturbed or agitated, these restless souls
cause the sand around them to swirl and form into a loose vortex
that vaguely resembles their physical body in life. They can
control these shapes as they controlled their physical bodies.

**Traceless Movement.** Sand silhouettes glide through the
sand without leaving a trace or creating any telltale sign of
their approach, which makes it easy for them to surprise even
cautious travelers with their sudden attacks from below.

**Undead Nature.** A sand silhouette doesn’t require air, food,
drink, or sleep.

nonmagical, loose sand without disturbing the material it is
moving through. It is :ref:`srd:invisible` while burrowing this way.

**Vulnerability to Water.** For every 5 feet the sand
silhouette moves while touching water, or for
every gallon of water splashed on it, it

silhouette is completely immersed in
water, it takes 10 (4d4) cold damage.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The sand silhouette makes two
slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target. *Hit:* 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If both attacks
hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is :ref:`srd:grappled` (escape
DC 14), and the sand silhouette engulfs it.

**Engulf.** The sand silhouette engulfs a Medium or smaller
creature grappled by it. The engulfed target is :ref:`srd:blinded` and
:ref:`srd:restrained`, but no longer grappled. It must make a successful
DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the
sand silhouette’s turns or take 14 (3d6 + 4) bludgeoning
damage. If the sand silhouette moves, the engulfed target
moves with it. The sand silhouette can only engulf one creature
at a time.

**Haunted Haboob (Recharge 4-6).** The sand silhouette turns
into a 60-foot radius roiling cloud of dust and sand filled with
frightening shapes. A creature that starts its turn inside the
cloud must choose whether to close its eyes and be :ref:`srd:blinded`
until the start of its next turn, or keep its eyes open and make
a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the
creature is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature
repeats the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
