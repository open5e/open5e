Soul Eater
----------

*Creatures of variable appearance, soul eaters conjoin fleshy
elements with ectoplasmic forms.*

**Called from the Abyss.** Soul eaters are summoned from
the Abyss and other extraplanar ports of call where they can
freely barter for prey. They always have a mental link with their
summoner, and often seek to destroy them.

**Devour Essences.** Soul eaters do not devour crude flesh,
instead feasting on a victim’s soul and spirit.

**Hatred of the Sun God.** They bear a particular antipathy
for followers of the sun god, and they will go to great lengths to
kill his clergy, even defying the wishes of their summoners on
occasion.

**Caster Link.** When a soul eater is summoned, it creates
a mental link between itself and its conjurer. If the soul
eater’s assigned target (see Find Target ability, below) dies
before the soul eater can drain the target’s soul, or if the
soul eater is defeated by its target (but not
slain), it returns to its conjurer at full speed
and attacks. While the soul eater and the
conjurer share the same plane, it can use its
Find Target ability to locate its conjurer.

**Find Target.** When a soul eater’s conjurer
orders it to find a creature, it can do
so unerringly, despite the distance or
intervening obstacles, provided the target is
on the same plane of existence. The conjurer
must have seen the desired target and must speak
the target’s name.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The soul eater makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
*Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) psychic
damage, or half as much psychic damage with a successful DC
15 Constitution saving throw.

**Soul Drain.** If the soul eater reduces a target to 0 hit points, the
soul eater can devour that creature’s soul as a bonus action.
The victim must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw.
Success means the target is dead but can be restored to life
by normal means. Failure means the target’s soul is consumed
by the soul eater and the target can’t be restored to life with
:ref:`srd:clone`, :ref:`srd:raise-dead`, or :ref:`srd:reincarnate`. A :ref:`srd:resurrection`, *miracle*, or
:ref:`srd:wish` spell can return the target to life, but only if the caster
succeeds on a DC 15 spellcasting check. If the soul eater is
killed within 120 feet of its victim’s corpse and the victim
has been dead for no longer than 1 minute, the victim’s soul
returns to the body and restores it to life, leaving the victim
unconscious and stable with 0 hit points.
