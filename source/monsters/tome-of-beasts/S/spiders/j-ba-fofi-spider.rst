J’ba Fofi Spider
----------------

*A large, brown spider that resembles a tarantula with
exaggeratedly long legs gracefully emerges from the
bushes, followed by similar arachnids that are
smaller and yellow in color.*

The j’ba fofi resembles an oversized
tarantula with very long legs, although
a flicker of intelligence indicates this
species evolved above mere vermin.

**Spider Pack Leaders.** The
youngest are yellow in color, but
their hairs turn brown as they age.
Immature j’ba fofi pull ordinary
spiders into their fellowship in
teeming masses that follow along
wherever they roam.

**Fond of Camouflage.** The
natural coloring of a j’ba fofi,
along with its proficiency
at camouflage—their
hair-like bristles are usually
covered in a layer of leaves—
makes it virtually invisible in
its natural environment.
They weave leaves and
other forest litter into
their webs to create well-hidden, enclosed lairs.

**Skills** Stealth +5 (+7 in forest or jungle terrain)

**Challenge** 3 (700 XP)

**Camouflaged Webs.** It takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom
(Perception) check to spot the j’ba fofi’s web. A creature
that fails to notice a web and comes into contact with it is
:ref:`srd:restrained` by the web. A restrained creature can pull free from
the web by using an action and making a successful DC 12
Strength check. The web can be attacked and destroyed (AC
10; hp 5; vulnerable to fire damage; immune to bludgeoning,
poison, and psychic damage).

**Spider Climb.** The j’ba fofi can climb difficult surfaces,
including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make
an ability check.

**Spider Symbiosis.** No ordinary spider will attack the j’ba fofi
unless magically controlled or the j’ba fofi attacks it first. In
addition, every j’ba fofi is accompanied by a swarm of spiders
(a variant of the swarm of insects), which moves and attacks
according to the j’ba fofi’s mental command (commanding the
swarm does not require an action by the j’ba fofi).

**Web Sense.** While in contact with a web, the j’ba fofi knows the
exact location of any other creature in contact with the same
web.

**Web Walker.** The j’ba fofi ignores movement restrictions caused
by webbing.

Actions
~~~~~~~

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit:* 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage plus 22 (5d8) poison
damage, or half as much poison damage with a successful DC
12 Constitution saving throw. A target dropped to 0 hit points

even after regaining hit points.
