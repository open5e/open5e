Gypsosphinx
-----------

*With black wings and a body pale as alabaster, the vulture-beaked
gypsosphinx is easy to identify. As powerful servants of the gods of
death and the desert, their riddles and obsessions all hinge on death
and carrion. Their eyes can spot prey miles away, and the distance
they climb into the sky hides their enormous size.*

The pale gypsosphinx shines in the desert sun and stands out
in underground tombs and caverns, yet it can conceal itself when
it flies in moonlit clouds. Gypsosphinxes are found anywhere
bodies are buried or left to rot, and they harvest corpses from
battlefields of warring desert tribes.

**Gossips and Riddlers.** Gypsosphinxes converse with
intelligent undead, priests of death gods, and with other
sphinxes, but they rarely gather among their own kind. They
guard their territory jealously, typically claiming a necropolis as
the heart of their region.

Like all sphinxes, gypsosphinxes enjoy riddles. They rely on
magic to solve challenging riddles they can’t solve on their own.

**Night Flyers.** Unlike most of their cousins, gypsosphinxes
are gifted fliers capable of diving steeply from the night sky to
snatch carrion or a sleeping camel. The stroke of midnight has a
special but unknown significance for the beasts.

**Foretell Doom.** Occasionally, a paranoid noble seeks out a
gypsosphinx and entreats the creature to reveal the time and
place of his or her death, hoping to cheat fate. A gypsosphinx
demands a high price for such a service, including payment in
corpses of humans, unusual creatures, or near-extinct species.
Even if paid, the gypsosphinx rarely honors its side of the
bargain; instead, it turns its death magic against the supplicant,
bringing about his or her death then and there.

**Inscrutable.** The sphinx is immune to any effect that would
sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as any
divination spell that it refuses. Wisdom (Insight) checks made to
ascertain the sphinx’s intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.

**Magic Weapons.** The sphinx’s weapon attacks are magical.

**Mystic Sight.** A gypsosphinx sees death coming and can foretell
the manner of a person’s death. This ability does not come
with any urge to share that information. Gypsosphinxes are
notorious for hinting, teasing, and even lying about a creature’s
death (“If we fight, I will kill you and eat your heart. I have seen
it,” is a favorite bluff).

**Spellcasting.** The sphinx is a 9th-level spellcaster. Its
spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit
with spell attacks). It requires no material components to cast
its spells. The sphinx has the following wizard spells prepared:
