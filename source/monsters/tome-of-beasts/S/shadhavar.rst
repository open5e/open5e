Shadhavar
---------

*Often a shadhavar is first noticed for the haunting melody it
makes, and some mistake them for unicorns or fey steeds. On closer
inspection, they look like desiccated unicorns, their skeletons clearly
visible beneath their taut flesh.*

**Shadow Horses.** Shadhavar are natives of the plane of
Shadow. Although they resemble undead unicorns, they are
living creatures imbued with shadow essences.

**Fey and Undead Riders.** While the shadhavar are intelligent
creatures, they sometimes serve as mounts for the shadow fey,
noctiny, hobgoblins, wights, or other creatures. They expect
to be treated well during such an arrangement; more than one
unkind rider has ridden off on a shadhavar and never returned.

**Deceptive Hunters.** Shadhavar use their hollow horn to
play captivating sounds for defense or to draw in prey. They hunt
when they must and are not discriminating about their quarry,
but shadhavar primarily eat carrion. Despite their horrific
appearance, they are not naturally evil.

**Innate Spellcasting.** A shadhavar’s innate spellcasting ability
score is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can cast the following
spells, requiring no components:

**At will:** :ref:`srd:disguise-self` (as horse or unicorn only)

**2/day:** :ref:`srd:darkness` (centered on itself, moves with the shadhavar)

**Magic Weapons.** A shadhavar’s gore attacks are magical.

**Plaintive Melody (3/day).** As a bonus action, a shadhavar can
play a captivating melody through its hollow horn. Creatures
within 60 feet that can hear the shadhavar must make a
successful DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be :ref:`srd:charmed` until the
start of the shadhavar’s next turn. A creature charmed in this
way is :ref:`srd:incapacitated`, its speed is reduced to 0, and a shadhavar
has advantage on attack rolls against it.

**Shadesight.** A shadhavar’s darkvision functions in magical
darkness.
