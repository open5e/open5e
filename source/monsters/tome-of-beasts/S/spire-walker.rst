Spire Walker
------------

*This miniscule creature kicks up a ghostly, sparkling fire when it
jostles and jigs. Lightning sparks fly between it and its perch.*

**Storm Dancers.** When storm clouds gather over cities,
harbors, and twisted badlands, electrical energy fills the air.
During these times, miniscule fey dance on church steeples,
desolate peaks, and ships’ masts.

Also called corposanti by scholars, spire walkers are nature
spirits that delight in grandiose displays of thunderbolts. They
can be found frolicking in a thunderstorm or keeping company
with blue dragons or storm giants—though these larger
creatures often chase them off for being a nuisance.

**Small and Metallic.** These spire walkers stand no more
than a foot tall, with dusky blue-gray skin and shocks of silvery,
slate, or pale blue hair. Spire walkers prefer clothing in metallic
hues with many buttons, and they always carry a handful of
tiny copper darts that they hurl at each other during their
incomprehensible games. When excited, they emit a
sparking glow from the tips of their noses, eyebrows, ears,
and pointy shoes.

They play rough-and-tumble games among themselves and
enjoy pranking bystanders with frightening but mostly harmless
electric shocks. If a spire walker perishes during the fun, the
others pause just long enough to say “awww, we’ll miss you”
and go through their comrade’s pockets before continuing with
the game.

**Love Copper and Amber.** Spire walkers like gold but they
love copper. They prefer it over all other metals, and they keep
the copper pieces in their pockets brilliantly polished. They also
value amber gems. Among a group of spire walkers, the leader
is not the cleverest or most ruthless, but the one displaying the
most ostentatious amber jewel.
