Wormhearted Suffragan
---------------------

*This humanoid wears robes to hide its corpselike pallor and lifeless
gray hair. Fine, arm-length worms wriggle through abscesses in
its flesh and its empty eye-sockets. It moves stooped over, with a
shuffling gait, belying its speed and agility.*

**Dark Worm Hearts.** Their hearts have been replaced with a bulbous,
writhing conglomeration of worms, which permits them to
carry on with an undead mockery of life.

**Prey on the Wounded.** They frequent graveyards, casting
detect evil or speak with dead to learn who was truly cruel and
duplicitous in life. They also follow armies, visiting battlefields
shortly after the fighting is over. In the guise of nurses or
chirurgeons, they select their targets from among the dead
and dying for as long as they remain undetected. In both cases,
they cast animate dead to provide the worm goddess with viable
skeletal or zombie servants.

**Fear Light and Radiance.** Wormhearted suffragans have
a weakness; they are especially susceptible to the flesh-searing
power of radiant magic, and for this reason avoid priests of the
sun god or gods of light. At night, however, they are a walking
contagion, infesting their enemies with parasitic worms that
devour victims from within. Their favorite tactic is to cast hold
person, attack with a helminth infestation, then animate their
slain enemies into unlife.

**Undead Nature.** A wormhearted suffragan doesn't require
air, food, drink, or sleep.

~~~~~~~

**Multiattack.** The wormhearted suffragan can make two
helminth infestation attacks, or it can cast one spell and make
one helminth infestation attack.

**Helminth Infestation.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5
ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6)
necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed
on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be afflicted with a
helminth infestation (parasitic worms). An afflicted creature
can’t regain hit points and its hit point maximum decreases by
10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the affliction reduces
the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the victim dies. The
affliction lasts until removed by any magic that cures disease.
