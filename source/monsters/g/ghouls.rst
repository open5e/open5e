**Stench**: Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the ghast
must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until
the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature
is immune to the ghast’s Stench for 24 hours. **Turning Defiance**: The
ghast and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving
throws against effects that turn undead.

Actions

**Bite**: *Melee Weapon Attack*: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
*Hit*: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage. **Claws**: *Melee Weapon Attack*:
+5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.
If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a
DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success.
