Class Abilities
---------------

Druidic
^^^^^^^

You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the
language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know
this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the
message's presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom

(Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.

Spellcasting
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to
shape that essence to your will.

Cantrips
~~~~~~~~

At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the :ref:`srd:druid-spells`
list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher
levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

Preparing and Casting Spells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells
of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must
expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended
spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast,
choosing from the :ref:`srd:druid-spells` list. When you
do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier +
your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level
for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level
and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells
can a include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you
prepare the 1st-level spell *cure wounds,* you can cast it using a
1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from
your list of prepared spells.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer
and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your
list.

Spellcasting Focus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use a druidic focus (see :ref:`srd:adventuring-gear`) as a
spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

Spellcasting Ability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your
magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your
Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In
addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC
for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

  **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

  **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Ritual Casting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag
and you have the spell prepared.

Wild Shape
^^^^^^^^^^

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the
shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature
twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown
in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform
into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't
have a flying or swimming speed.

Beast Shapes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

=====  ===  ===========================  =======
Level  CR   Limitations                  Example
=====  ===  ===========================  =======
2nd    1/4  No flying or swimming speed  Wolf
4th    1/2  No flying speed              Crocodile
8th    1    ---                            Giant eagle
=====  ===  ===========================  =======

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your
druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless
you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal
form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically
revert if you fall :ref:`srd:unconscious`, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

-  Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but
   you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and
   Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw
   proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the
   creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat
   block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of
   yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't
   use them.
-  When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice.
   When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit
   points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a
   result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to
   your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form
   and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long
   as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points,
   you aren't knocked :ref:`srd:unconscious`.
-  You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action
   that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast
   form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've
   already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are
   part of a spell, such as *call lightning*, that you've already cast.
-  You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or
   other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable
   of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such
   as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
-  You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space,
   merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions
   as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical for the new
   form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and
   size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new
   form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall
   to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form
   has no effect until you leave the form.

Druid Circle
^^^^^^^^^^^^

At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids, such as the Circle
of the Land. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and
again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

Ability Score Improvement
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't
increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Timeless Body
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to
age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1
year.

Beast Spells
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Beginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any
shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and
verbal

components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able
to provide material components.

Archdruid
^^^^^^^^^

At 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.

Additionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your
druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and
aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal
shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.

Druid Circles
-------------

Circle of the Land
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard
ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids
meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal
secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief
priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors
to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is
influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's
mysterious rites.

Bonus Cantrip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid
cantrip of your choice.

Natural Recovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by
sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest,
you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a
combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level
(rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You
can't use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two
levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or
two 1st-level slots.

Circle Spells
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to
cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to
circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose
that land---arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or
swamp---and consult the associated list of spells.

Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and
it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.
If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell
list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

Land's Stride
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs
you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants
without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they
have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are
magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created
by the :ref:`srd:entangle` spell.

Nature's Ward
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you reach 10th level, you can't be :ref:`srd:charmed` or :ref:`srd:frightened` by
elementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.

Nature's Sanctuary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your
connection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or
plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving
throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature
must choose a different target, or the attack automatically misses. On a
successful save, the creature is immune to this effect for 24 hours.
The creature is aware of this effect before it makes
its attack against you.

Druid Traditions
----------------

Sacred Plants and Wood
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash,
birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and
yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus,
incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.

Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as
weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon
handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is
associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent
hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as
shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown
weapons, such as darts or javelins.

Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen
other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert
region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.

Druids and the Gods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids
are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the
multiverse (the lists of gods in :ref:`srd:fantasy-historical-pantheons`
include many such deities).
The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient
tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.
