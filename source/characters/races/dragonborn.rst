**Draconic Ancestry.** You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of
dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage
resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.

**Breath Weapon.** You can use your action to exhale destructive
energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage
type of the exhalation.

When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the
exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by
your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your
Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6
damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful
one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and
5d6 at 16th level.

After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you
complete a short or long rest.

**Damage Resistance.** You have resistance to the damage type
associated with your draconic ancestry.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.
Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used
in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures
and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.
