Selling Treasure
----------------

Opportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and
more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures
and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided
that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.

**Arms, Armor, and Other Equipment.** As a general rule, undamaged
weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a
market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough
condition to sell.

**Magic Items.** Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone
to buy a potion or a scroll isn't too hard, but other items are out of
the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few
common magic items, you won't normally come across magic items or spells
to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should
always be treated as such.

**Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects.** These items retain their full
value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or
use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable
treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or
larger community first.

**Trade Goods.** On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions
through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods---bars of iron,
bags of salt, livestock, and so on---retain their full value in the market
and can be used as currency.
