Sentient Magic Items
------------------------------------------------------


Some magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might
be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware
thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves
like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and
sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its
wielder or a continual thorn in the side.

Most sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest
sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never
sentient.

Sentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM's control. Any
activated property of the item is under the item's control, not its
wielder's. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the
item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the
relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties
or even turn them against the wielder.

Creating Sentient Magic Items
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item's
persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions
described here.

Abilities
^^^^^^^^^

A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You
can choose the item's abilities or determine them randomly. To determine
them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and
totaling the rest.

Communication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its
emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud.
You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table.

======  ==============
d100    Communication
======  ==============
01--60  The item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.
61--90  The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages.
91--00  The item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any character that carries or wields it.
======  ==============

Senses
^^^^^^

With sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its
surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or
roll on the following table.

==  ===========
d4  Senses
==  ===========
1   Hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet.
2   Hearing and normal vision out to 60 feet
3   Hearing and normal vision out to 120 feet.
4   Hearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.
==  ===========

Alignment
^^^^^^^^^

A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might
suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the
following table.

+---------------+---------------------+----+---------------+----------------------+
| d100          | Alignment           |    | d100          | Alignment            |
+===============+=====================+====+===============+======================+
| 01--15        | Lawful good         |    | 74--85        | Chaotic neutral      |
+---------------+---------------------+----+---------------+----------------------+
| 16--35        | Neutral good        |    | 86--89        | Lawful evil          |
+---------------+---------------------+----+---------------+----------------------+
| 36--50        | Chaotic good        |    | 90--96        | Neutral evil         |
+---------------+---------------------+----+---------------+----------------------+
| 51--63        | Lawful neutral      |    | 97--00        | Chaotic evil         |
+---------------+---------------------+----+---------------+----------------------+
| 64--73        | Neutral             |    |               |                      |
+---------------+---------------------+----+---------------+----------------------+

Special Purpose
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the
exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder's use of the item aligns
with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from
this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and
could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated
properties. You can pick a special purpose or roll on the following
table.

+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| d10        | Purpose                                                                                                                                       |

+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

| 9          | *Destiny Seeker:* The item is convinced that it and its wielder have key roles to play in future events.                                      |
+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 10         | *Creator Seeker:* The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it was created.                                                      |
+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Conflict
~~~~~~~~

A sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and
alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item's
alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs,
the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder's Charisma
check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the
following demands:

-  The item insists on being carried or worn at all times.

-  The item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds
   repugnant.

-  The item demands that its wielder pursue the item's goals to the
   exclusion of all other goals.

-  The item demands to be given to someone else. If its wielder refuses
   to comply with the item's wishes, the item can do any or all of the
   following:

-  Make it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.

-  Suppress one or more of its activated properties.

-  Attempt to take control of its wielder.

If a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder
must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item's
Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is :ref:`srd:charmed` by the item
for 1d12 hours. While :ref:`srd:charmed`, the wielder must try to follow the item's
commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw,
ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user
succeeds or fails, the item can't use this power again until the next
dawn.
