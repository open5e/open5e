Armor
-----

Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different
cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason,
adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from
leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other
kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly
available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three
categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors
supplement their armor with a shield.

The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the
common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.

**Armor Proficiency.** Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a
shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to
wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with
certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency
with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or
attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast
spells.

**Armor Class (AC).** Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The
armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.

**Heavy Armor.** Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to
move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows "Str 13"
or "Str 15" in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces
the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score
equal to or higher than the listed score.

**Stealth.** If the Armor table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth
column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

**Shields.** A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one
hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit
from only one shield at a time.

Light Armor
~~~~~~~~~~~

Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile
adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing
mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to
the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

**Padded.** Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and
batting.

**Leather.** The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are
made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest
of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.

**Studded Leather.** Made from tough but flexible leather, studded
leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.

Medium Armor
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also
impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity
modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to
determine your Armor Class.

**Hide.** This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is
commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who
lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.

**Chain Shirt.** Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is
worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest
protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings
rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.

**Scale Mail.** This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and
perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of
metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.

**Breastplate.** This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece
worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms
relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the
wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.

**Half Plate.** Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover
most of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond
simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.

Heavy Armor
~~~~~~~~~~~

Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection.
These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a
wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight
and bulk.

Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor
Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is
negative.

**Ring Mail.** This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into
it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and
axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by
those who can't afford better armor.

**Chain Mail.** Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes
a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing
and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.

**Splint.** This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal
riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding.
Flexible chain mail protects the joints.

**Plate.** Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to
cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather
boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the
armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.

Getting Into and Out of Armor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor's category.

**Don.** This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from
the armor's AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.

**Doff.** This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have
help, reduce this time by half.
