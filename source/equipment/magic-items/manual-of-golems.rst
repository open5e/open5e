Manual of Golems
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, very rare*

This tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a
particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it
randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster
with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can't use
a *manual of golems* and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic
damage.

To create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table,
working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no
more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to
purchase supplies.

Once you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch
flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are
sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and
obeys your spoken commands.
