Berserker Axe
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (any axe), rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your hit
point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.

**Curse.** This axe is cursed, and becoming attuned to
it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are
unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within reach at all times.
You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this
one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.

Whenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your
possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go
berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to
attack the creature nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra
attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks,
moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current
target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random.
You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60
feet of you that you can see or hear.
