Well of Many Worlds
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, legendary*

This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a
handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold and place the *well of many worlds* on a
solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world
or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides
where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking
hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once *well of many
worlds* has opened a portal, it can't do so again for 1d8 hours.
