Staff of Charming
------------------------------------------------------


*Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer,
warlock, or wizard)*

While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10
charges to cast :ref:`srd:charm-person`, :ref:`srd:command`, or :ref:`srd:comprehend-languages`
from it using your spell save DC. The staff can also be used as a magic
quarterstaff.

If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an
enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save
into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again
until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment
spell that targets only you, with or without the staff's intervention,
you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the
spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.

The staff regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical
quarterstaff.
