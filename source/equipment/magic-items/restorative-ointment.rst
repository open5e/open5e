Restorative Ointment
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains 1d4 + 1 doses of a thick
mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2
pound.

As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to
the skin. The creature that receives it regains 2d8 + 2 hit points,
ceases to be :ref:`srd:poisoned`, and is cured of any disease.
