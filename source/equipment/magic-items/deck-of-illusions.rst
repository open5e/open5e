Deck of Illusions
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A
deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 − 1 cards.

The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you
can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can
use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the
ground at a point within 30 feet of you.

An illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and
remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the
appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that
it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory
creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically
anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the
illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass
through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature
identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.

The illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled.
When the illusion ends, the
image on its card disappears, and that card can't be used again.
