The cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain spells or
comes into contact with certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in
the table below.

**Spell or Item Charges Lost**

*Disintegrate* 1d12 *Horn of blasting* 1d10 *Passwall* 1d6

*Prismatic spray* 1d20

*Wall of fire* 1d4

Cubic Gate
^^^^^^^^^^

*Wondrous item, legendary*

This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The
six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence,
one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes
determined by the GM.

You can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the *gate*
spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side.
Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can
cast the *plane shift* spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport
the targets to the plane keyed to that side.

The cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube
regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.

Dagger of Venom
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Weapon (dagger), rare*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon.

You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade.
The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon
hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for 1
minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

Dancing Sword
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*

You can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and
speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies
up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of
it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage
rolls.

While the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up
to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same
bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5
feet of it.

After the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30
feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it
falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path
to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground.
It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away
from it.
