Spell Scroll
------------------------------------------------------


*Scroll, varies*

A *spell scroll* bears the words of a single spell, written in a
mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can
read the scroll and cast its spell without providing
any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.
Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell's normal casting time.
Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust.
If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.

If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than
you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your
spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The

DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell
disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw
DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the
Spell Scroll table.

A wizard spell on a *spell scroll* can be copied just as
spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a
*spell scroll*, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana)
check with a DC equal to 10

-  the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is
   successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the
   *spell scroll* is destroyed.
