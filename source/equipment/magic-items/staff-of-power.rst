Staff of Power
------------------------------------------------------


*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or
wizard)*

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus
to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2
bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains
2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge,
roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage
rolls but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains 1d8 + 2
charges.

**Power Strike.** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff,
you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.

**Spells.** While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend
1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it,
using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus:
:ref:`srd:cone-of-cold` (5 charges),
:ref:`srd:fireball` (5th-level version, 5 charges),
:ref:`srd:globe-of-invulnerability` (6 charges),
:ref:`srd:hold-monster` (5 charges),
:ref:`srd:levitate` (2 charges),
:ref:`srd:lightning-bolt` (5th-level version, 5 charges),
:ref:`srd:magic-missile` (1 charge),
:ref:`srd:ray-of-enfeeblement` (1 charge), or
:ref:`srd:wall-of-force` (5 charges).

**Retributive Strike.** You can use an action to break the staff over
your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike.
The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion
that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of
existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you
take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff.
Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on
how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following
table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

======================  ================
Distance from Origin    Damage
======================  ================
10 ft. away or closer   8 × the number of charges in the staff
11 to 20 ft. away       6 × the number of charges in the staff
21 to 30 ft. away       4 × the number of charges in the staff
======================  ================
