Ring of X-ray Vision
------------------------------------------------------


*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command
word. When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1
minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects
within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from
passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch
of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances
block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.

Whenever you use the ring again before taking a
long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain
one level of :ref:`srd:exhaustion`.
