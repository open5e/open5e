Javelin of Lightning
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (javelin), uncommon*

This javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command
word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide
that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in
the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much
damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin
when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the
target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6
lightning damage.

The javelin's property can't be used again until the next dawn. In the
meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.
