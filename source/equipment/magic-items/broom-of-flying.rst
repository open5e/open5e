Broom of Flying
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This wooden broom, which weighs 3 pounds, functions like a mundane broom
until you stand astride it and speak its command word. It then hovers
beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50
feet. It can carry up to 400
pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200
pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.

You can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of
you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar
with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another
command word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.
