Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rare*

While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the
bowl's command word and summon a water elemental, as if you had cast the
*conjure elemental* spell. The bowl can't be used this way again until
the next dawn.

The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3
pounds and holds about 3 gallons.
