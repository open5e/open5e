Slippers of Spider Climbing
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across
vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your
hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.
However, the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a slippery
surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.

Sovereign Glue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Wondrous item, legendary*

This viscous, milky-­white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond
between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has
been coated inside with *oil of slipperiness.* When found, a container
contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-­foot square surface. The glue takes
1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken
only by the application of *universal solvent* or *oil of etherealness*,
or with a *wish* spell.

Spell Scroll
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Scroll, varies*

A *spell scroll* bears the words of a single spell, written in a
mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can use
an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to
provide any of the spell's components. Otherwise, the scroll is
unintelligible.

If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than
you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your
spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The

DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell
disappears from the scroll with no other effect. Once the spell is cast,
the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw
DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the
Spell Scroll table.

A wizard spell on a *spell scroll* can be copied just as
spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a
*spell scroll*, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana)
check with a DC equal to 10

-  the spell's level. If the check succeeds, the spell is
   successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the
   *spell scroll* is destroyed.
