Vorpal Sword
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (any sword that deals slashing damage), legendary (requires
attunement)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.

When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon
and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's
heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A
creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage,
doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides
that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this
weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from
the hit.
