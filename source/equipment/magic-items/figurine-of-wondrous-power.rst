Figurine of Wondrous Power
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rarity by figurine*

A *figurine of wondrous power* is a statuette of a beast small enough to
fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and
throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the
figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature
would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there
isn't enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn't become a
creature.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your
languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the
creature defends itself but takes no other actions.

The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end
of the duration, the creature reverts to its
figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit
points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while
touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property
can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as
specified in the figurine's description.

**Golden Lions (Rare).** These gold statuettes of lions are always
created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each
can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can't
be used again until 7 days have passed.

**Ivory Goats (Rare).** These ivory statuettes of goats are always
created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions
differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:

-  The *goat of traveling* can become a Large goat with the same
   statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or
   portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has
   charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of
   charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7
   days have passed, when it regains all its charges.

-  The *goat of travail* becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it
   has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.

-  The *goat of terror* becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat
   can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons.
   One horn becomes a *+1 lance*, and the other becomes a *+2
   longsword*. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons
   disappear and the horns return
   when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a
   30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature
   hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC
   15 Wisdom saving throw or be :ref:`srd:frightened` of the goat for 1 minute, or
   until the goat reverts to figurine form. The :ref:`srd:frightened` creature can
   repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
   effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the
   effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24
   hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until
   15 days have passed.

**Marble Elephant (Rare).** This marble statuette is about 4 inches
high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has
been used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

**Obsidian Steed (Very Rare).** This polished obsidian horse can
become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to
defend itself. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 5
days have passed.

If you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each
time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to
figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your
orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random
location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine
form.

**Onyx Dog (Rare).** This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff
for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak
Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see
:ref:`srd:invisible` creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been
used, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

**Serpentine Owl (Rare).** This serpentine statuette of an owl can
become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be
used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically
communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of
existence.

**Silver Raven (Uncommon).** This silver statuette of a raven can
become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be
used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine
allows you to cast the :ref:`srd:animal-messenger` spell on it at will.
