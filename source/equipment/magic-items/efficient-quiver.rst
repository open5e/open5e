Efficient Quiver
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional
space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing
more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty
arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to
eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up
to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular
quiver or scabbard.
