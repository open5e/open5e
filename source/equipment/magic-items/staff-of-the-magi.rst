Staff of the Magi
------------------------------------------------------


*Staff, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or
wizard)*

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus
to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a
+2 bonus to spell attack rolls.

The staff has 50 charges for the following properties. It regains 4d6 +
2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a
d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12 + 1 charges.

**Spell Absorption.** While holding the staff, you have advantage on
saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction
when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do,
the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and
gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell's level.
However, if doing so brings the staff's total number of charges above
50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see
below).

**Spells.** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend
some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using
your spell save DC and spellcasting ability:

  :ref:`srd:conjure-elemental` (7 charges),
  :ref:`srd:dispel-magic` (3 charges),
  :ref:`srd:fireball` (7th-level version, 7 charges),
  :ref:`srd:flaming-sphere` (2 charges),
  :ref:`srd:ice-storm` (4 charges),
  :ref:`srd:invisibility` (2 charges),
  :ref:`srd:knock` (2 charges),
  :ref:`srd:lightning-bolt`
  (7th-level version, 7 charges),
  :ref:`srd:passwall` (5 charges),
  :ref:`srd:plane-shift` (7 charges),
  :ref:`srd:telekinesis` (5 charges),
  :ref:`srd:wall-of-fire` (4 charges), or
  :ref:`srd:web` (2 charges).

You can also use an action to cast one of the
following spells from the staff without using any charges:

  :ref:`srd:arcane-lock`,
  :ref:`srd:detect-magic`,
  :ref:`srd:enlarge-reduce`,
  :ref:`srd:light`,
  :ref:`srd:mage-hand`, or
  :ref:`srd:protection-from-evil-and-good`.

**Retributive Strike.** You can use an action to break the staff over
your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike.
The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion
that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to
a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to
avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of
charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of
damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in
the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much
damage.


======================  ================
Distance from Origin    Damage
======================  ================
10 ft. away or closer   8 × the number of charges in the staff
11 to 20 ft. away       6 × the number of charges in the staff
21 to 30 ft. away       4 × the number of charges in the staff
======================  ================
