Hammer of Thunderbolts
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (maul), legendary*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon.

**Giant's Bane (Requires Attunement).** You must
be wearing a :ref:`srd:belt-of-giant-strength` (any variety) and :ref:`srd:gauntlets-of-ogre-power` to attune to this weapon. The attunement ends if you take
off either of those items. While you are attuned to this weapon and
holding it, your Strength score increases by 4 and can exceed
20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this
weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw or die.

The hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to
it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the
hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range
of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer
unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every
creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw or be :ref:`srd:stunned` until the end of your next turn. The hammer
regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.
