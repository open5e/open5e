Hammer of Thunderbolts
------------------------------------------------------


*Weapon (maul), legendary*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon.

**Giant’s Bane (Requires Attunement).** You must

be wearing a *belt of giant strength* (any variety) and *gauntlets of
ogre power* to attune to this weapon. The attunement ends if you take
off either of those items. While you are attuned to this weapon and
holding it, your Strength score increases by 4 and can exceed

20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this
weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw or die.

The hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to

it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the
hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range
of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer
unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every
creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. The hammer
regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

Handy Haversack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Wondrous item, rare*

This backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is
an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of
material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central
pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack
always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.

Placing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for
interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires
you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific
item, the item is always magically on top.

The haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp
object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed.
If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although
an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned
inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must
be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is
placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10
minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.

Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a *bag
of holding*, *portable hole*, or similar item instantly destroys both
items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where
the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of
the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the
Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-­way only and can’t
be reopened.

Hat of Disguise
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the *disguise
self* spell from it at will. The spell ends if the hat is removed.
