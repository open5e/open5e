Iron Flask
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, legendary*

This iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the
flask's command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60
feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than
the one you're on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving
throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the
flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a
creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only
one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn't need to
breathe, eat, or drink and doesn't age.

You can use an action to remove the flask's stopper and release the
creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your
companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you
give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its
death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of
the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal
disposition and alignment.

An :ref:`srd:identify` spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the
only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly
discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or
determined randomly.
