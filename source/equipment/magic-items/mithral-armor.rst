Mithral Armor
---------------------------------------------------


*Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon*

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate
can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes
disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength
requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.
