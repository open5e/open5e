Wind Fan
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

While holding this fan, you can use an action to cast the *gust of wind*
spell (save DC 13) from it. Once used, the fan shouldn't be used again
until the next dawn. Each time it is used again before then, it has a
cumulative 20 percent chance of not working and tearing into useless,
nonmagical tatters.
