Robe of Scintillating Colors
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at
dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to
cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until
the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds bright light
in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Creatures
that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In
addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when the
robe's power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
become :ref:`srd:stunned` until the effect ends.
