Cloak of Arachnida
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint silvery
threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits:

-  You have resistance to poison damage.

-  You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed.

-  You can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down
   along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

-  You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as
   if they were difficult terrain.

-  You can use an action to cast the :ref:`srd:web` spell (save DC 13). The web
   created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this
   property of the cloak can't be used again until the next dawn.
