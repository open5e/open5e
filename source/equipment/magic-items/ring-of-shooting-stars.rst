Ring of Shooting Stars
------------------------------------------------------


*Ring, very rare (requires attunement outdoors at night)*

While wearing this ring in dim light or darkness, you can cast *dancing
lights* and :ref:`srd:light` from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the
ring requires an action.

The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring
regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Faerie Fire.** You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast *faerie
fire* from the ring.

**Ball Lightning.** You can expend 2 charges as an action to create
one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning. The more spheres you
create, the less powerful each sphere is individually.

Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet
of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating
on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot
radius.

As a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no
farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you
comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that
creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage
based on the number of spheres you created.

=======  =====================
Spheres  Lightning Damage
=======  =====================
4        2d4
3        2d6
2        5d4
1        4d12
=======  =====================

**Shooting Stars.** You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For
every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the
ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within
a 15-foot cube originating from that point is showered in sparks and
must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
