Candle of Invocation
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity's
alignment. The candle's alignment can be detected with the :ref:`srd:detect-evil-and-good` spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or
determines the alignment randomly.

======  =============
d20     Alignment
======  =============
1--2    Chaotic evil
3--4    Chaotic neutral
5--7    Chaotic good
8--9    Neutral evil
10--11  Neutral
12--13  Neutral good
14--15  Lawful evil
16--17  Lawful neutral
18--20  Lawful good
======  =============

The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires
an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can
snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in
increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot
radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of
the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with
advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment
matches the candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared
without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast
with a 1st-level slot.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can
cast the :ref:`srd:gate` spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.
