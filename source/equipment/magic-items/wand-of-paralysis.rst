Wand of Paralysis
------------------------------------------------------


*Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 of its charges to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip
toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must
succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be :ref:`srd:paralyzed` for 1
minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can repeat the
saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes
and is destroyed.
