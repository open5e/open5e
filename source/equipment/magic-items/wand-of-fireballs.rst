Wand of Fireballs
------------------------------------------------------


*Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the :ref:`srd:fireball` spell (save DC
15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level version of the spell.
You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge
you expend.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes
and is destroyed.
