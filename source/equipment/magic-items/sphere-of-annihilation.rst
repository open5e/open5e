Sphere of Annihilation
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, legendary*

This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse,
hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.

The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that
passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is
susceptible to damage from a *sphere of annihilation*, it passes through
the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't
wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.

The sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60
feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25
Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one
direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your
Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves
10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must
succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking
4d10 force damage.

If you attempt to control a sphere that is under
another creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check
contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The
winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as
normal.

If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that
created by the :ref:`srd:gate` spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that
within a *portable hole*, the GM determines randomly what happens, using
the following table.

=========  ======================
d100       Result
=========  ======================
01--50     The sphere is destroyed.
51--85     The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.
86--00     A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence.
