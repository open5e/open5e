Lantern of Revealing
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil,
shedding bright light in a 30-­foot radius and dim light for an
additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long
as they are in the lantern’s bright light. You can use an action to
lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-­ foot radius.

Luck Blade
^^^^^^^^^^

*Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic
weapon. While the sword is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to
saving throws.

**Luck.** If the sword is on your person, you can call on its luck (no
action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving
throw you dislike. You must use the second roll. This property can’t be
used again until the next dawn.

**Wish.** The sword has 1d4 – 1 charges. While holding it, you can use
an action to expend 1 charge
and cast the *wish* spell from it. This property can’t be used again
until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.
