Lantern of Revealing
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil,
shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an
additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long
as they are in the lantern's bright light. You can use an action to
lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.
