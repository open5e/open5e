Wand of Magic Missiles
------------------------------------------------------


*Wand, uncommon*

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to
expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the *magic missile* spell from
it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can
increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you
expend.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend
the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes
and is destroyed.
