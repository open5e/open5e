Arrow-Catching Shield
------------------------------------------------------


*Armor (shield), rare (requires attunement)*

You gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this
shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC. In
addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target
within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of 
the attack instead.
