Universal Solvent
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, legendary*

This tube holds milky liquid with a strong alcohol smell. You can use an
action to pour the contents of the tube onto a surface within reach. The
liquid instantly dissolves up to 1 square foot of adhesive it touches,
including *sovereign glue.*
