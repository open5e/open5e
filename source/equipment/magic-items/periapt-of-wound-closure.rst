Periapt of Wound Closure
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the
start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain
hit points, double the number of hit points it restores.

Philter of Love
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Potion, uncommon*

The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this
philter, you become charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature
is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it
as your true love while you are charmed. This potion's rose-hued,
effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a
heart.
