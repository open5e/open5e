Circlet of Blasting
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the *scorching
ray* spell with it. When you make the spell's attacks, you do so with an
attack bonus of

+5. The circlet can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
