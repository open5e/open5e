Glamoured Studded Leather
------------------------------------------------------


*Armor (studded leather), rare*

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. You can also use a
bonus action to speak the armor's command word and cause the armor to
assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of
armor. You decide what it looks like, including color, style, and
accessories, but the armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The
illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove
the armor.
