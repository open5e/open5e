Staff of Thunder and Lightning
------------------------------------------------------


*Staff, very rare (requires attunement)*

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus
to attack and damage rolls made with it. It also has the following
additional properties. When one of these properties is used, it can't be
used again until the next dawn.

**Lightning.** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you
can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 lightning damage.

**Thunder.** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can
cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder, audible out to 300 feet. The
target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or
become :ref:`srd:stunned` until the end of your next turn.

**Lightning Strike.** You can use an action to cause a bolt of
lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and
120 feet long. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity
saving throw, taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.

**Thunderclap.** You can use an action to cause the staff to issue a
deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60
feet of you (not including you) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes
:ref:`srd:deafened` for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half
damage and isn't :ref:`srd:deafened`.

**Thunder and Lightning.** You can use an action to use the Lightning
Strike and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so doesn't
expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.
