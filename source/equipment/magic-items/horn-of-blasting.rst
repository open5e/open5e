Horn of Blasting
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rare*

You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the
horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible
600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes
5d6 thunder damage and is :ref:`srd:deafened` for 1 minute. On a successful save, a
creature takes half as much damage and isn't :ref:`srd:deafened`. Creatures and
objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw
and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn
to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and
destroys the horn.
