Censer of Controlling Air Elementals
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rare*

While incense is burning in this censer, you can use an action to speak
the censer's command word and summon an air elemental, as if you had
cast the *conjure elemental* spell. The censer can't be used this way
again until the next dawn.

This 6-­inch-­wide, 1-­foot-­high vessel resembles a

chalice with a decorated lid. It weighs 1 pound.
