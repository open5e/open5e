Bag of Devouring
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, very rare*

This bag superficially resembles a :ref:`srd:bag-of-holding` but is a feeding
orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside
out closes the orifice.

The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is
placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the
bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is
placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a
50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature
inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC
15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the
bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength
check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that
starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.

Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot
of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects
inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM
determines the time and plane.

If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained
within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.
