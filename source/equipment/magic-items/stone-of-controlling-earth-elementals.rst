Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rare*

If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its
command word and summon an earth elemental, as if you had cast the
*conjure elemental* spell. The stone can’t be used this way again until
the next dawn. The stone weighs 5 pounds.
