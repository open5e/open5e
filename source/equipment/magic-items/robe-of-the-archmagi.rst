Robe of the Archmagi
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock,
or wizard)*

This elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of white, gray, or
black and adorned with silvery runes. The robe's color corresponds to
the alignment for which the item was created. A white robe was made for
good, gray for neutral, and black for evil. You can't attune to a *robe
of the archmagi* that doesn't correspond to your alignment.

You gain these benefits while wearing the robe:

-  If you aren't wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 15 + your
   Dexterity modifier.

-  You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical
   effects.

-  Your spell save DC and spell attack bonus each increase by 2.
