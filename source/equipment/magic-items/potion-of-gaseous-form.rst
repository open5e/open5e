Potion of Gaseous Form
------------------------------------------------------


*Potion, rare*

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the *gaseous form*
spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect
as a bonus action. This potion's container seems to hold fog that moves
and pours like water.
