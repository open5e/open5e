Ring of Free Action
------------------------------------------------------


*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*

While you wear this ring, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra
movement. In addition, magic can
neither reduce your speed nor cause you to be :ref:`srd:paralyzed` or :ref:`srd:restrained`.
