Staff of Swarming Insects
------------------------------------------------------


*Staff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer,
warlock, or wizard)*

This staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at
dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a swarm of
insects consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses.

**Spells.** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend
some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using
your spell save DC: *giant insect* (4 charges) or *insect plague* (5
charges).

**Insect Cloud.** While holding the staff, you can use an action and
expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless flying insects to spread
out in a 30-foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10 minutes,
making the area heavily obscured for creatures other than you. The swarm
moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles
per hour disperses the swarm and ends the effect.
