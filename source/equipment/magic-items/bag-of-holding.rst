Bag of Holding
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside
dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The
bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet.
The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of

its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.

If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is
destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the
bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the
bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures
inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided
by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they
begin to suffocate.

Placing a *bag of holding* inside an extradimensional space created by a
:ref:`srd:handy-haversack`, :ref:`srd:portable-hole`, or similar item instantly destroys
both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10
feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral
Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be
reopened.
