Talisman of Pure Good
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of good
alignment)*

This talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness. A creature that is neither
good nor evil in alignment takes 6d6 radiant damage upon touching the
talisman. An evil creature takes 8d6 radiant damage upon touching the
talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it
ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

If you are a good cleric or paladin, you can use the talisman as a holy
symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or
hold it.

The talisman has 7 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can
use an action to expend 1 charge from it and choose one creature you can
see on the
ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of evil alignment, a
flaming fissure opens under it. The target must succeed on a DC 20
Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed,
leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its
existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman disperses into
motes of golden light and is destroyed.
