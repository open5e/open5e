Dust of Dryness
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an
action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of
water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or
rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is
negligible.

Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface,
causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed.
Doing so ends that pellet's magic.

An elemental composed mostly of water that is
exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving
throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
