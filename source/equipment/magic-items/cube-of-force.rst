Cube of Force
------------------------------------------------------


*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*

This cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on
it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains
1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.

You can use an action to press one of the cube's faces, expending a
number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of
Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has
insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of
invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a
side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1
minute, until you use an action to press the cube's sixth face, or the
cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier's effect by
pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number
of charges, resetting the duration.

If your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid
object that can't pass through the cube, you can't move any closer to
that object as long as the barrier remains.
