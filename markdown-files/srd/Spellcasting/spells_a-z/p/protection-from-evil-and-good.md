Title: Protection from Evil and Good
-------------------------

## Protection from Evil and Good

#### 1st-level abjuration


**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and
iron, which the spell consumes)

**Duration:** Concentration up to 10 minutes


Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected
against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals,
fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have
disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t
be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the target is already
charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has
advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
