Races
------
### Racial Traits
The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races.

#### Ability Score Increase
Every race increases one or more of a character's ability scores.

#### Age
The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race's expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.

#### Alignment
Most races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.

#### Size
Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in "Equipment."

#### Speed
Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling ( "Adventuring") and fighting ("Combat").

#### Languages
By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.

#### Subraces
Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world.

### Dwarf
#### Dwarf Traits
Your dwarf character has an assortment of inborn abilities, part and parcel of dwarven nature.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Constitution score increases by 2.

**_Age._** Dwarves mature at the same rate as humans, but they're considered young until they reach the age of 50. On average, they live about 350 years.

**_Alignment._** Most dwarves are lawful, believing firmly in the benefits of a well-­ordered society. They tend toward good as well, with a strong sense of fair play and a belief that everyone deserves to share in the benefits of a just order.

**_Size._** Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.

**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.

**_Darkvision._** Accustomed to life underground, you

have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**_Dwarven Resilience._** You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.

**_Dwarven Combat Training._** You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.

**_Tool Proficiency._** You gain proficiency with the artisan's tools of your choice: smith's tools, brewer's supplies, or mason's tools.

**_Stonecunning._** Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.

#### Hill Dwarf
As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.

**_Dwarven Toughness._** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level.

### Elf
#### Elf Traits
Your elf character has a variety of natural abilities, the result of thousands of years of elven refinement.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

**_Age._** Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.

**_Alignment._** Elves love freedom, variety, and self-­ expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The drow are an exception; their exile has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.

**_Size._** Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.

**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**_Darkvision._** Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

**_Keen Senses._** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

**_Fey Ancestry._** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**_Trance._** Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice.

After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.

**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.

#### High Elf
As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-­elves and even other elves. The other type is more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Intelligence score increases by 1.

**_Elf Weapon Training._** You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.

**_Cantrip._** You know one cantrip of your choice from the wizard spell list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for it.

**_Extra Language._** You can speak, read, and write one extra language of your choice.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Dexterity score increases by 2.

**_Age._** A halfling reaches adulthood at the age of 20 and generally lives into the middle of his or her second century.

**_Alignment._** Most halflings are lawful good. As a rule, they are good-­hearted and kind, hate to see others in pain, and have no tolerance for oppression. They are also very orderly and traditional, leaning heavily on the support of their community and the comfort of their old ways.

**_Size._** Halflings average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.

**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

**_Lucky._** When you roll a 1 on the d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll.

**_Brave._** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

**_Halfling Nimbleness._** You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.

**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Common and Halfling. The Halfling language isn't secret, but halflings are loath to share it with others. They write very little, so they don't have a rich body of literature. Their oral tradition, however, is very strong. Almost all halflings speak Common to converse with the people in whose lands they dwell or through which they are traveling.

#### Lightfoot
As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You're inclined to be affable and get along well with others.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Charisma score increases by 1.

**_Naturally Stealthy._** You can attempt to hide even when you are obscured only by a creature that is at least one size larger than you.

**_Ability Score Increase._** Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.

**_Alignment._** Dragonborn tend to extremes, making

a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil. Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with evil can be terrible villains.

White      | Cold            | 15 ft. cone (Con. save)

**_Draconic Ancestry._** You have draconic ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table. Your breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by the dragon type, as shown in the table.

**_Breath Weapon._** You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.

When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful

one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.

After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

**_Damage Resistance._** You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.

**_Languages._** You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.

### Gnome

and most are expected to settle down into an adult life by around age 40. They can live 350 to almost 500 years.

**_Alignment._** Gnomes are most often good. Those who tend toward law are sages, engineers, researchers, scholars, investigators, or inventors. Those who tend toward chaos are minstrels, tricksters, wanderers, or fanciful jewelers. Gnomes are good-­hearted, and even the tricksters among them are more playful than vicious.

**_Size._** Gnomes are between 3 and 4 feet tall and average about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.

**_Speed._** Your base walking speed is 25 feet.

**_Darkvision._** Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing it to keep the device functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time, you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time.

When you create a device, choose one of the following options:

_Clockwork Toy._ This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.

_Fire Starter._ The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.

_Music Box._ When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song's end or when it is closed.
