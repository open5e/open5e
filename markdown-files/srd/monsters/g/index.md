**Senses** darkvision 120 ft., passive Perception 13

**Languages** Auran

**Challenge** 11 (7,200 XP)

**Elemental Demise**: If the djinni dies, its body disintegrates into a warm breeze, leaving behind only equipment the djinni was wearing or carrying. **Innate Spellcasting**: The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: **At will**: _detect evil and good_, _detect magic_, _thunderwave_ **3/day each**: _create food and water_ (can create wine instead of     water), _tongues_, _wind walk_ **1/day each**: _conjure elemental_ (air elemental only),     _creation_, _gaseous form_, _invisibility_, _major image_, _plane     shift_

The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains     concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the     djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength     saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the     whirlwind up to 60 feet as an action, and creatures restrained by     the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses     sight of it.

```
A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the
whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18
Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer
restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.

**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11;

**Languages** any languages it knew in life;

**Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP)

**Ethereal Sight**: The ghost can see 60 feet into the Ethereal     Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa. **Incorporeal Movement**: The ghost can move through other creatures     and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10)     force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

Actions

**Withering Touch**: _Melee Weapon Attack_: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,     one target. _Hit_: 17 (4d6 + 3) necrotic damage. **Etherealness**: The ghost enters the Ethereal Plane from the     Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane     while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't     affect or be affected by anything on the other plane. **Horrifying Visage**: Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of     the ghost that can see it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving     throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If the save fails by 5 or more,     the target also ages 1d4 × 10 years. A frightened target can repeat     the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the     frightened condition on itself on a success. If a target's saving     throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune     to this ghost's Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging     effect can be reversed with a _greater restoration_ spell, but only     within 24 hours of it occurring. **Possession (Recharge 6)**: One humanoid that the ghost can see     within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or     be possessed by the ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target     is incapacitated and loses control of its body. The ghost now     controls the body but doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The     ghost can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect,     except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment,     Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed     and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics,     but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features,     or proficiencies.

```
The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost
ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by
an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession
ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of
the body. The target is immune to this ghost’s Possession for 24
hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession
ends.

On a failure, the creature     can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8     to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature     does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus     action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly     determined direction.

**Challenge** 9 (5,000 XP)

**Acid Absorption**: Whenever the golem is subjected to acid damage,     it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal     to the acid damage dealt. **Berserk**: Whenever the golem starts its turn with 60 hit points     or fewer, roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its     turns while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it     can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the     golem attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller     than itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so     until it is destroyed or regains all its hit points. **Immutable Form**: The golem is immune to any spell or effect that     would alter its form. **Magic Resistance**: The golem has advantage on saving throws     against spells and other magical effects. **Magic Weapons**: The golem's weapon attacks are magical.

Actions

**Multiattack**: The golem makes two slam attacks. **Slam**: _Melee Weapon Attack_: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.     _Hit_: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a     creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or     have its hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the     damage taken. The target dies if this attack reduces its hit point     maximum to 0. The reduction lasts until removed by the greater     restoration spell or other magic. **Haste (Recharge 5–6)**: Until the end of its next turn, the golem     magically gains a +2 bonus to its AC, has advantage on Dexterity     saving throws, and can use its slam attack as a bonus action.

```
The golem’s creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can try
to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must be
able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC 15
Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem ceases
being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit points or
fewer, the golem might go berserk again.
