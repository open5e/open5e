Actions

**Multiattack**: The captain makes three melee attacks: two with its     scimitar and one with its dagger. Or the captain makes two ranged     attacks with its daggers. **Scimitar**: _Melee Weapon Attack_: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,     one target. _Hit_: 6 (1d6 + 3) slashing damage. **Dagger**: _Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack_: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.     or range 20/60 ft., one target. _Hit_: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.

Reactions

**Parry**: The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack     that would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and     be wielding a melee weapon.

It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The **bandit captain** has these qualities in spades.

In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the **pirate captain** is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.

More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain's colorful reputation.
