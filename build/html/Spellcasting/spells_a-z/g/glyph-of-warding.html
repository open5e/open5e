<p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Range:</strong> Touch</p>
<p><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200
gp, which the spell consumes)</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> Until dispelled or triggered</p>
<p>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other
creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor
or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a
scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a
surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10
feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in
its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast
this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being
triggered.</p>
<p>The glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence
(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.</p>
<p>You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs
inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or
standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph,
approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the
object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an
object, the most common triggers include opening that object,
approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or
reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.</p>
<p>You can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under
certain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such as
height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to
affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions
for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a
certain password.</p>
<p>When you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.</p>
<p><strong>*Explosive Runes.*</strong> When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical
energy in a 20 foot radius sphere centered on the glyph. The sphere
spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity
saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or
thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the
glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<p><strong>*Spell Glyph.*</strong> You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or lower
in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must
target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no
immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the
stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it targets the creature
that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is
centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile creatures or
creates harmful objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to
the intruder and attack it. If the spell requires concentration, it
lasts until the end of its full duration.</p>
<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th
level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8
for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can
store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the
glyph of warding.</p>
