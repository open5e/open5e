You are not necessarily a cleric performing sacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.\r\n\r\nChoose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being from among those listed in "Fantasy-Historical Pantheons" or those specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature\r\nof your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master that you now deny.',

Their flaws might be some hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken to an extreme.\r\n\r\n| d8 | Personality Trait |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| 1 | I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer to that person's deeds and example. |\r\n| 2 | I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies, empathizing with them and always working toward peace. |\r\n| 3 | I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen |\r\n| 4 | Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude. |\r\n| 5 | I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost every situation. |\r\n| 6 | I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or condemn) the worship of other gods. |\r\n| 7 | I've enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my temple's elite. Rough living grates on me. |\r\n| 8 | I've spent so long in the temple that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world. |\r\n\r\n| d6 | Ideal |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| 1 | Tradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice must be preserved and upheld. (Lawful) |\r\n| 2 | Charity. I always try to help those in need, no matter what the personal cost. (Good) |\r\n| 3 | Change. We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in the world. (Chaotic) |\r\n| 4 | Power. I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith's religious hierarchy. (Lawful) |\r\n| 5 | Faith. I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have faith that if I work hard, things will go well. (Lawful) |\r\n| 6 | Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my god's favor by matching my actions against his or her teachings. (Any) |\r\n\r\n| d6 | Bond |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| 1 | I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was lost long ago. |\r\n| 2 | I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who branded me a heretic. |\r\n| 3 | I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents died. |\r\n| 4 | Everything I do is for the common people. |\r\n| 5 | I will do anything to protect the temple where I served. |\r\n| 6 | I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider heretical and seek to destroy. |\r\n\r\n| d6 | Flaw |\r\n|---|---|\r\n| 1 | I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely. |\r\n| 2 | I put too much trust in those who wield power within my temple's hierarchy. |\r\n| 3 | My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that profess faith in my god. |\r\n| 4 | I am inflexible in my thinking. |\r\n| 5 | I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them. |\r\n| 6 | Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life. |",
