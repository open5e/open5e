     * - If your application supports Accounts in any organizational directory, replace "Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here" value with organizations.
     * - If your application supports Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts, replace "Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here" value with common.
     * - To restrict support to Personal Microsoft accounts only, replace "Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here" value with consumers.
