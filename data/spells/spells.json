You can choose from\nany of the following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on\nyour turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose a different one.\n\nFlood. You cause the water level of all standing water\nin the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore,\nthe flooding water spills over onto dry land.\n\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a\n20 foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other\nand then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave’s path\nare carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles\nstruck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing.\n\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a\ndifferent effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on\nthe start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\n\nPart Water. You cause water in the area to move apart\nand create a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the\nseparated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains until\nthe spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly\nfills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal\nwater level is restored.\n\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to\nmove in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over\nobstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in the\narea moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell’s area,\nit resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions. The water continues\nto move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a\ndifferent effect.\n\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least\n50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the\ncenter of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at\nthe\n\nbase, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or\nobject in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet\ntoward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength\n(Athletics) check against your spell save DC.\n\nWhen a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts\nits turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save,\nthe creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex\nuntil the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half\ndamage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex\ncan use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described\nabove, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.\n\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object\ntakes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round it remains\nin the vortex.",

For glyphs\ninscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or\nstanding on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph,\napproaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the\nobject on which the glyph is inscribed.

You can also set conditions\nfor creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those who say a\ncertain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes\nor a spell glyph.\n\nExplosive Runes.

The condition can be as specific or\nas elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition is\nreasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions can be\nbased on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise must be\nbased on\n\nobservable actions or qualities and not based on intangibles such as\nlevel, class, or hit points.\n\nA dispel magic spell can end the spell only if\nit is cast as a 9th level spell, targeting either the prison or the\nspecial component used to create it.\n\nYou can use a particular special component to create only one prison at\na time.

You don’t need to meet any requirements in that spell,\nincluding costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\n\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your\nchoice:\n\n\nYou create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a magic\nitem. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it\nappears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n\n\nYou allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit\npoints, and you end all effects on them described in the\ngreater restoration spell.\n\nYou grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage\ntype you choose.\n\nYou grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or\nother magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself\nand all your companions immune to a lich’s life drain attack.\n\nYou undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made\nwithin the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes\nitself to accommodate the new result. For example, a\nwish spell could undo an opponent’s successful save, a\nfoe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save. You can force the reroll\nto be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to\nuse the reroll or the original roll.\n\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above\nexamples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has\ngreat latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater\nthe wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This\nspell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly\nachieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of\nhow you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead\nmight propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no\nlonger alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing\nfor a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to\nthe presence of the item’s current owner.\n\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than\nduplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each\ntime you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10\nnecrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be reduced or\nprevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn’t\n3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend\nresting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining\nrecovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance\nthat you are unable to cast wish ever again if\nyou suffer this stress.",
