# Developing on the Website (this repo)

Open5e uses the Nuxt3 framework for Vue3, which takes care of a lot of the architectural work for the frontend layer while allowing a large amount of flexibility.

## Build Setup

After cloning this repo, from /open5e

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# Optional: point it at a real API by setting API_URL=https:someurl.com
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000. If you
$ npm run dev
```
By default, the UI layer will point to the live API. If you want to change this, you can set an environment variable for "API_URL" and direct it to a local API source. (Usually localhost:8888 if you're using the api at https://github.com/eepMoody/open5e-api

Other build options:

```
# build for production and launch server
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
