# Build and run the UI layer

Open5e uses the Nuxt framework for Vue.js, which takes care of a lot of the architectural work for the frontend layer while allowing a large amount of flexibility.

By default, the UI layer will point to the live API. If you want to change this, you can set an environment variable for "API_URL" and direct it to a local API source. (Usually localhost:8888 if you're using the api at https://github.com/eepMoody/open5e-api

## Build Setup

From /open5e

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# Optional: point it at a real API by setting API_URL=https:someurl.com
# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000. If you
$ npm run dev
```

Other build options:

```
# build for production and launch server
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
